<h2>THE DESULTORY REMARKER.</h2>

<h3>No. X.</h3>


<p>When casting around for topics, to
which the attention of my readers
may be solicited, they sometimes start
up in almost every quarter; and the
principal difficulty arises in the task
of selection. It is, however, altogether
probable, that like the young
lady, who after disregarding the pretensions
of men of sense and merit,
at length gives her hand to some
empty-pated coxcomb, my final determination
may not always furnish
the most conclusive evidence of wisdom
or correct taste. Notwithstanding
this may be the case, it is possible
that here and there, at distant intervals,
something may be found from
which improvement may be derived
by those who are in pursuit of it.</p>

<p>On the present occasion, the attention
of my little circle is respectfully
invited to a few of the occurrences of
the passing year. We are now approaching
the confines of winter, that
season which has been called with
great propriety its old age. Previously
to its commencement, and during
the continuance of what in this
country is called Indian Summer, the
face of nature is expressive of pleasing
melancholy; the sun divested of
his ordinary radiance, courts our gaze&mdash;the
prevailing stillness is only invaded
by the falling leaf&mdash;and every
phasis in which we behold her, is
serene and tranquil. At such a period
we are led into a train of sober
and rational reflection; and for a moment,
feel wisely disposed to appropriate
to our advantage, the truths
which it reveals. In contemplating
the progress of decay, and witnessing
the beauties with which we are surrounded,
successfully fading before
our eyes, we are forcibly reminded of
the solemn fact, that human life, with
all its sublunary enjoyments, is also
rapidly hastening to the tomb. We
in some degree become familiar with
the image of dissolution; and the departure
of those of our friends and
acquaintances, who have during the
past months joined "the immense
majority of the dead," is by the power
of association brought to our remembrance.
Most of them entered on the
present year full of life and hope, and
had every prospect of outliving many
who are now their survivors; but
alas! how vague and uncertain are all
human calculations. The past summer
and autumn, have in many parts
of our otherwise highly favoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
country, been accompanied with <span class="smcap">FEVER</span>
in its various appalling forms;
and numerous have been the victims
to this minister of death. Our own
metropolis was for some time the
seat of painful apprehension, and no
one could doubt the presence of a
most malignant visiter, whose footsteps
were, however, mercifully arrested
by an overruling hand. <span class="smcap">New-Orleans</span>
and <span class="smcap">Savannah</span> have experienced
more weighty and tremendous
affliction from this source; and
the sufferings of their inhabitants
claim our deep and sincere sympathy.
Many of the laws of nature are
still concealed from our observation;
but it is our duty to collect authentic
facts, to reason from what we know,
so that in some instances we may
ascend from effects to their causes.
<em>It is certainly the part of wisdom, in
relation to</em> <span class="smcap">YELLOW FEVER</span>, <em>to guard
with vigilance every supposed avenue
of approach, whether domestic or foreign</em>.
The season has been remarkable
in many respects. The earth
has been unusually fruitful of her
productions: the crops of bread-stuffs,
and vegetables of every description,
have been almost unprecedented.&mdash;Apples
were never known to be so
abundant and cheap. It may not
moreover be altogether unworthy of
remark, that myriads of musquitoes
have for many weeks past been our
unwelcome guests. Whether there
be any necessary connexion between
these circumstances or not, and in
what manner it exists, is the proper
business of philosophy to inquire, and
if possible determine.</p>

<p>Among the events which have recently
passed in review before us of
Pennsylvania, although we disclaim
the character of politicians, the recent
general election could not have been
entirely a matter of indifference. But
whether the election of a <span class="smcap">Governor</span>,
conducted as it is here with an inordinate
excitement of all the angry
passions, be promotive of the great
moral interests of society, is at least
questionable. Peaceable citizens very
naturally keep aloof from such a conflict;
and from this circumstance
alone, the commonwealth sustains
great loss. Whether the immense
patronage and influence of that important
office could not be so lessened,
by a partial distribution among
other public functionaries, without
impairing its essential dignity and
usefulness; and in this way the constant
recurrence of such disreputable
spectacles be obviated as that we
have recently witnessed, is certainly
a question of great moment to the
tranquillity and character of the state.</p>

<p>Belonging as we do to the great family
of man, we cannot glance across
the Atlantic at the important transactions
of that region, without feeling
an interest of no ordinary kind. Reference
is here particularly made to
the bloodless revolutions of Spain,
Naples, and Portugal. We are hostile
to the spirit of revolution, as such,
but the character of these is well fitted
to excite our "special wonder."
And it is anxiously to be desired, that
the welfare of the people of those
countries may have been substantially
promoted by them; for it ought to
be remembered, that governments
are instituted for the good of the
whole, and not exclusively for the
benefit of priests and kings. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
Christians and patriots, we may on
this subject be permitted to entertain
such wishes as these.</p>

<p>With regard to Great Britain, few
of us can advert to what is there
transpiring at present, in relation to
royalty, without blushing for the land
of our fathers;&mdash;the land of <span class="smcap">Newton</span>
and <span class="smcap">Locke</span>, of <span class="smcap">Milton</span>, of <span class="smcap">Young</span>,
and of <span class="smcap">Cowper</span>. The drama referred
to, disgraceful as it is, is nevertheless
fruitful of salutary lessons. Of these
it may be observed, this is not the
least striking and important, that however
elevated station may be, it is still
accessible to the consequences of
guilt; and its occupant may be made
to tremble at their approach. We
may also derive from its incidents, an
argument in favour of our own form
of government, comparatively simple
and unimposing as it is in its structure;
but not less efficient with respect
to the legitimate objects of government,
without which, properly
administered, the fabric of society
would crumble into ruins, and lawless
violence usurp the seat of order and
justice. <big><strong>☞</strong></big></p>

<h2>THE VILLAGE TEACHER.</h2>


<p>One morning during the present
autumn, I made an early excursion
through the fields. The sky was
unclouded, and the eastern horizon
was in a glow with those saffron hues
that usher in the day. The stream
before me, unruffled by a breath of
air, gave back the shape and colour
of the landscape as distinctly as in a
mirror. A few chirping insects, and
now and then a warble, sometimes
half heard from a distant grove, and
sometimes bursting full upon the ear,
were all that broke the silence.</p>

<p>Captivated and riveted by the scene,
I sat down under a favourite beech-tree,
to enjoy it at my leisure. In
such situations, the mind naturally
falls into that train of musing which
is most habitual; and I was soon lost
in meditations upon the inexhaustible
beauty and magnificence of Nature,
and those lessons of deep philosophy
which are to be learned in its school.
From one thought I passed to another,
till insensibly I fell into the following
revery.</p>

<p>Methought that beside me was a
hill, whose rocky sides seemed almost
inaccessible. The ascent was somewhat
easier near the top, which glowed
as if it were on fire. Before the
hill was a fertile and beautiful plain,
which was terminated by a barren
heath, and that, by the waters of a vast
lake. A path, the beginning of which
I could not discover, seemed to wind
round the foot of the hill, till it came
to where there was somewhat of an
opening in rocks, and divided. One
part took the direction of the plain,
and was soon lost in innumerable avenues.
The other ascended the hill,
in nearly a straight direction to the
summit.</p>

<p>Where the path divided, there were
stationed two beings of a celestial appearance.
One of them, who guarded
the ascent to the hill, was a youth
of severe but manly beauty.</p>

<p>A female stood at the entrance to
the plain. She was elegantly though
loosely dressed; her head was crowned
with a chaplet of flowers, and her
whole contour was that of perfect
beauty&mdash;yet there was a certain boldness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
and forwardness in her mien, that
however it might captivate some,
rather checked the advances of those
whose self-command was not disarmed
by her beauty.</p>

<p>I perceived a crowd of persons
advancing along the great road, towards
these beings; and when they
came to where it forked, they seemed
urged forward by an irresistible impulse,
yet doubtful which path to pursue.
Many attempted to ascend the
hill, allured no doubt by the splendour
of its summit. Yet I observed
that the greater part of these, after
toiling a little way up the ascent,
turned back, after many a wistful look
at the valley which lay behind them.
The greater part of the travellers,
however, chose the direction of the
valley. Some were allured by the
sight of verdant banks and shady
groves, and by the strains of exquisite
melody ever and anon wafted to
their ears.</p>

<p>Many were enticed by the Portress
of the Plain, who assured them that
there was a much easier and pleasanter
way to the summit of the hill
through her dominions. When they
had once entered, it seemed like a
region of enchantment. The main
path, as I have mentioned, speedily
lost itself in innumerable branches.&mdash;Many
of these seemed to wind along
the foot of the hill, so that the travellers
easily persuaded themselves that
they would soon find the road which
the Genius had promised, and pitied
the ascetic toil of those who were
scaling the mountain.</p>

<p>The inducements to repose, and
the pleasures by the wayside, were,
however, innumerable. Here a flower
of uncommon beauty solicited their
admiration, while umbrageous retreats
and cooling fountains, presented
themselves at every turn. Beings
of celestial beauty were loitering in
the shade&mdash;willing to be caressed,
and ever ready to beguile the way
with music and song. At one time
they would invite the pilgrims to
taste the golden fruits, which hung
from the branches; or to listen to the
melody of some songster of the grove.
At another they would join in the
wanton dance, "to the warbling of
the lascivious lute," and lull their
senses into oblivion with music like
that of Circe. Every sense was gratified;
the sky was serene and brilliant,
the landscape in its summer
beauty, and the breeze was loaded
with fragrance and melody.</p>

<p>By degrees the paths lost their
former direction, and all tended towards
the end of the plain. I could
see that the sirens, who so fatally beguiled
the way, kept aloof from this
part of the valley, and lingered among
the cool and shady retreats at the entrance.
Yet the travellers seemed,
as before, urged on by an irresistible
impulse; although, as they advanced,
the way became less pleasant, the
groves and the flowers less frequent
and luxuriant, and the melody of the
birds less enchanting. The sun now
shone with intolerable ardour, and the
plain ended in a burning sandy desert,
trackless and unwatered. The few
sirens who still accompanied them,
and who were before so irresistibly
charming, lost by degrees their youth
and beauty. A few withered hags
were all that now remained. The
lute and the myrtle wreath were exchanged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
for a whip of snakes and a
dagger. With these they chased the
band of miserable bloated wretches,
urging them farther and farther from
the last vestige of delight. I could
see a number of winged boys, flying
about, and armed with a bow and a
quiver of arrows. They discharged
their weapons at random, among the
deluded travellers on the plain.&mdash;Their
shafts most frequently fell
blunted to the ground. But whomsoever
they pierced, seemed roused
as from a dream. The flowers, for
them, lost their fragrancy, the song
of the grove its music, and the banks
their verdure. The sun burnt with
tenfold rage, and they gazed on themselves
and their companions with horror.
Many of them turned and fled,
and though they were pursued by the
taunts and hisses of those around them,
seldom stopped until they had gained
the foot of the mountain. But the
greater number tore the darts wildly
from their bosoms, and pressed on
more desperately than before. The
wound, for a time, would appear to
be healed. But whenever they were
struck with the lashes of their pursuers,
it opened again&mdash;a rankling
and incurable sore. At every step
their torment increased. Frantic and
blaspheming, they hurried on towards
the end of the desert, where a grove
of blasted cedars seemed to promise
shade, and the sound of waters, refreshment.
But scarcely had they
gained the bank, when the billows
rolled over them, and closed for ever.
The howling of the winds, the dashing
of the waves, and the shrieks of
the dying, sent horror to my soul.&mdash;I
turned with pain from the prospect
to observe those who were ascending
the mountain. They seemed at first to
advance with difficulty, for the ascent
of the hill was steep and rocky. There
was but one path to its summit, and
this kept nearly a direct course, and
seldom bent itself to the inequalities of
the way. The travellers often stumbled
over the stones that obstructed
the passage, or tore themselves with
the briars that trailed along the way.
Sometimes they would unexpectedly
find themselves at the foot of a rock
that hid the prospect before them,
and seemed to bar up the passage.&mdash;But
an attentive observer might discover
along its side a steep and hazardous,
yet accessible path. Here
all their vigour and caution was requisite;
and when they had gained
the top, it was often only to discover
new difficulties. Such were the obstacles,
that many became disheartened,
and sighed after and sought the
voluptuous delights of the plain. The
air on the mountain was cool and
damp, and often overcast with clouds.
Yet the thunder seldom rolled but at
a distance, and the lightnings played
innoxiously away. The ground was
stony and barren, and seemed like a
rude and desolate rock. Yet clusters
of wild thyme, and chamomile, and
rosemary, grew among the crevices
of the stones; and shed around their
sweet, though wholesome and refreshing
perfumes. I observed several
beings of a mild and majestic appearance,
who went about removing and
lessening the obstructions of the way.
They raised and strengthened those
who had fallen, and encouraged the
laggard and the slothful. They cheered
their labours with the tale of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
mighty men of old, or bade them
mark the beauties before them, and
the dazzling brilliancy of the summit.
Whether it was from the invigorating
effects of the climate, or
the zeal and confidence with which
such discourse inspired them, the
travellers seemed to gather fresh
strength as they proceeded. Their
countenances beamed with cheerfulness
and hope, and they bounded over
the obstacles in the path with alacrity
and vigour. A transient gloom would
sometimes cloud their features, and
they would sometimes complain of
the asperities of the way. But a
glance at the radiance above, or a
smile from the good Genii who accompanied
them, would always restore
their wonted cheerfulness.</p>

<p>As they approached the summit,
the road became more smooth and
pleasant; the rude unsightly rock
was exchanged for groves and fields
of verdure. The air was purer, and
more transparent. The landscape
around was Nature in her sweetest
robe: arrayed not in the unripened
beauties of spring, or the gorgeous
magnificence of summer, it breathed
the tempered lustre, the full maturity,
the mild undazzling serenity of
autumn. The thrush, the robin, and
the turtle-dove, were heard from the
recesses of the grove; and the sky-lark
sent down his melody from on
high. Violets, jessamines, and honey-suckles,
were scattered along
the green, and wasted their sweets
abroad. The radiance from the summit
diffused a genial warmth around,
and the travellers seemed already to
enjoy the fruition of their labours,&mdash;But
as if conscious that greater felicity
was in view, they still pressed
forward till I could scarcely distinguish
them through the splendour
that enveloped the top of the mountain.&mdash;As
I was attentively gazing on
their progress, methought I could discover
a magnificent temple amidst the
blaze of glory. The dome, the walls,
and the pillars, shone like diamond
through the mountain crystal. In the
midst of the hall I could faintly trace
an altar smoking with incense. The
porticos and the area of the temple
were crowded with beings of celestial
beauty. Their robes were purer than
the driven snow, and their locks were
interwoven with gold and amaranth.
Some were watching the rolling incense
from the altar, and some were
hymning the praises of their heavenly
guide, or chanting the deeds of heroes.
Others welcomed the travellers
as they arrived, and led them rejoicing
to the midst of the temple.</p>

<p>My sight, dazzled and overpowered,
could behold them no longer.&mdash;The
shout of welcome, the song of
triumph, and the holy anthem, mellowed
and softened by the distance,
died sweetly away on my ear. "Happy
regions!" exclaimed I, "this is
indeed the abode of felicity. A thousand
deaths, ten thousand years of
anxiety and pain, would cheaply buy
an admission to your delights." The
violence of my emotion broke my
slumbers; and I awoke, like Mirza,
to behold, not indeed the camels of
the long valley of Bagdat, but the
awakening life and activity of the
country,&mdash;the sober herd marching
forth to their frugal pasture, the rattling
swain, and the busy sounds of
labour from the opposite hamlet.</p>

<h2>HUSBANDMEN,<br />

<span class="s07">AND THE HONOUR PAID TO AGRICULTURE
IN CHINA.</span></h2>

<p class="center">From Navarette, Le Comte, Du Halde, &amp;c.</p>


<p>The Husbandmen in China, as to
rank, are preferred to Merchants and
Mechanics. They are endowed with
large privileges, their profession being
considered as the most necessary
one in a state. Navarette observes,
that the Chinese say, that the Emperor
ought to take them under his particular
care, and to allow them as
large privileges as may be; because
all the empire subsists by their labour
and industry. Nay, it could not subsist
without the strongest inclination
and application of the country-people
that way! China being so vastly populous,
that if every inch of arable
land was sowed, as in fact it generally
is, yet the produce would be scarce
sufficient to support the multitudes
of inhabitants; and the empire is too
extensive to have its wants that way
supplied from foreign parts, even if
it kept up a correspondence with
them. For these reasons it has always
been one of the chiefest cares
of the government to promote Agriculture,
by honouring husbandmen
and their profession. With this view
a festival is instituted in honour of
agriculture; and the Emperor himself,
once a year, turns ploughman,
in imitation, as it is said, of the early
monarchs, whose history seems to be
calculated for the same end.</p>

<p>The common opinion, according
to the Missioners, is, that husbandry
was first taught by <i>Shin-nong</i>, who is
at this day reverenced as the inventor
of so useful an art; which has still
gained farther credit from what is related
in the books of their ancient
philosophers. The Emperor <i>Yau</i>,
who began to reign four hundred and
eighty years after the monarch, it
seems, set aside his own children in
favour of a young husbandman, whom
he chose for his successor. This
choice of an emperor out of the country,
has inspired the Chinese with a
great esteem for agriculture. <i>Yu</i>,
who succeeded <i>Shun</i>, came to the
throne after the same manner. It is
said, he found out the way, by means
of canals, to drain off the water into
the sea, which at the beginning of the
empire overflowed several low countries,
and afterwards made use of them
to render the soil fruitful. It is added
that he wrote several books concerning
the manner of cultivating
land, and watering it, which induced
<i>Shun</i> to appoint him his successor,
and has contributed much to raise the
credit of agriculture, as they see it
has been thought worthy the care and
application of a great Prince.</p>

<p>Several other emperors have expressed
their zeal for this art. <i>Kang
Vang</i>, third monarch of the <i>Chew</i>
family, caused land-marks to be fixed,
to prevent disputes among the husbandmen.
<i>King-Ving</i>, the twenty-fourth
of the same race, in whose
reign <i>Confusius</i> was born, five hundred
and thirty-one years before
Christ, renewed the laws that had
been made for promoting agriculture.
In a word, the Emperor <i>Ven-ti</i>, who
reigned three hundred and fifty-two
years after, raised its esteem to a great
pitch: for this Prince perceiving,
that his country was ruined by the
wars, to engage his subjects to cultivate
the land, set them an example
himself, by ploughing the fields belonging
to his palace: which obliged
all the ministers and gentlemen of his
court to do the same.</p>

<p>It is thought, that this was the original
of a great festival that is solemnized
every year in all the great cities
of China, when the sun enters the fifteenth
degree of aquarius; which the
Chinese look upon as the beginning
of the spring. On this day the Governor
comes out of his palace, carried
in his chair, preceded by banners,
lighted torches, and divers instruments;
he is attended with several
litters, painted, and adorned with a
variety of silk tapestry; exhibiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
various figures, and the portraits of
illustrious persons who had practised
husbandry, with histories relating to
the same subject! He is crowned
with flowers; and marches in this
equipage towards the eastern gate of
the city, as it were to meet the spring.</p>

<p>Among the figures, there is a cow
of earthenware, so monstrously large
that forty men can hardly carry it.&mdash;Behind
the cow, whose horns are gilt,
is a young child with one foot naked
and the other shod: him they call the
<em>genius of labour and diligence</em>; who
strikes the earthen cow incessantly
with a rod, as though it were to make
it advance. All the husbandmen follow
with their instruments; after
whom proceed companies of Masquers
and Comedians, acting plays.
In this manner they march to the
Governor's palace, where they strip
the cow of her ornaments; and drawing
out of her belly a prodigious
number of small cows made of clay,
and distribute them among the multitude,
as well as the fragments of the
cow, which they break into pieces.&mdash;Afterwards
the Governor makes a
short discourse, recommending the
care of husbandry as one of the things
most conducive to the good of a state.</p>

<p>The attention of the Emperors and
Mandarins to the cultivation of the
land is so great, that when deputies
arrive at court from the Vice-Roys,
the Chinese monarch never forgets
to demand in what condition the fields
appeared to them; and the falling of
a seasonable shower furnishes a proper
occasion for visiting a Mandarin,
to compliment him thereupon.&mdash;Every
year, in spring, which falls in
February, the Emperor (according to
the ancient custom) goes himself, in
a solemn manner, to plough a few
ridges of land, in order to animate
the husbandmen by his own example;
and the Mandarins of every city
perform the ceremony, which is as
follows&mdash;The tribunal of Mathematics
having, pursuant to orders, fixed
on the twenty-fourth of the second
moon, as the proper day for the ceremony
of tillage, that of the Rites gave
notice to the present Emperor <i>Yong-Ching</i>,
by a memorial which set forth
the following particulars to be observed
by him, preparatory to this festival.&mdash;1st.
That he should appoint 12
illustrious persons to attend and plough
after him, viz. three princes, and nine
presidents of the sovereign courts;
or the assistants of the latter, in case
they were too old, or infirm.&mdash;2nd.
That as this ceremony does not solely
consist in the Emperor's ploughing
the earth, in order to stir up emulation
by his own example; but also
includes a sacrifice, which he, as
Chief Pontiff, offers to <i>Shang-ti</i>, to
procure plenty from him in favour of
the people; therefore by way of preparation,
he ought to fast and observe
continence the three preceding days;
the Princes and Mandarins, who accompany
his Majesty, ought to prepare
themselves in the same manner.&mdash;3rd.
That on the eve of the ceremony,
his Majesty is to send several
Lords of the first quality to the Hall
of his ancestors, to prostrate themselves
before their Tablet, and give
them notice, as though they were yet
living, that the next day he will offer
the great sacrifice.</p>

<p>Besides these directions to the Emperor,
the tribunal likewise prescribes
the preparations to be made by the
different tribunals; one is obliged to
prepare the sacrifice; another to compose
the formula; another to carry
and set up the tents, under which his
Majesty is to dine, in case he so orders
it; a fourth is to assemble forty or
fifty husbandmen, venerable for their
age, who are to be present when the
Emperor ploughs the ground, with
forty of the younger sort to make
ready the ploughs, yoke the oxen,
and prepare the grain that is to be
sown; consisting of five sorts, supposed
to comprehend all the rest, as
wheat, rice, beans, and two kinds of
millet.</p>

<p>On the twenty-fourth day of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
moon, the Emperor went with his
whole court, in his habit of ceremony,
to the place appointed, to offer to
<i>Shang-ti</i> the spring sacrifice; by
which he is implored to increase and
preserve the fruits of the earth. The
place is a little hillock made of earth,
a few furlongs south from the city;
on the side of this elevation, which
ought to be fifty feet four inches high,
is the spot which is to be ploughed
by the Imperial hands.</p>

<p>After the Emperor had offered
sacrifices, he descended with the
three Princes and nine Presidents,
who were to plough with him. Several
great Lords carried the valuable
chests, which contained the grains
that were to be sown. All the court
attended with profound silence; then
the Emperor took the plough and
tilled the ground several times backwards
and forwards; when he quitted
it a prince of the blood held it and
ploughed; as did all the rest in their
turns. After having ploughed in
several places, the Emperor sowed
the different grain; and the day following,
the Husbandmen by profession,
(forty-four of them old and forty-two
of them young) finished the remainder
of the field that was left untilled.
The ceremony concluded with
the appointed reward, which the Emperor
bestowed upon each of them;
consisting of four pieces of dyed cotton
to make cloths.</p>

<p>The Governor of <i>Pe-King</i> goes
often to visit this field, which is cultivated
with great care; and examines
all the ridges thoroughly, to see if he
can meet with any uncommon ears,
such as they reckon good omens; on
which occasion he gives notice, that
he found a stalk, for instance, that
bore thirteen ears. In the autumn
the same governor gets in the grain
in yellow sacks; which are stowed in
a granary built for that purpose, called
the <em>Imperial Magazine</em>. This
grain is kept for the most solemn
ceremonies; for when the Emperor
sacrifices to <i>Tyen</i>, or <i>Shang-ti</i>, he
offers it as the fruit of his own hands;
and on certain days in the year, he
presents it to his ancestors, as if they
were still living.</p>

<p>Among several good regulations
made by the same Emperor, he has
shown an uncommon regard for the
Husbandmen. To encourage them
in their labour, he has ordered the
governors of all the cities to send him
notice every year, of the person of
this profession, in their respective
districts, who is most remarkable for
his application to agriculture; for
unblemished reputation; for preserving
union in his own family, and peace
with his neighbours; for his frugality
and aversion to extravagance. Upon
the report of the governor, the Emperor
will advance this wise and diligent
Husbandman to the degree of a
Mandarin of the eighth order, and
send him patents of an ordinary Mandarin;
which distinction will entitle
him to wear the habit of a Mandarin,
to visit the governor of the city, to sit
in his presence, and drink tea with him.
He will be respected all the
rest of his days.&mdash;After his death he
will have funeral obsequies suitable
to his degree; and his title of honour
shall be written in the hall of his ancestors.
What emulation must such
a reward excite among the Husbandmen!</p>

<p>Accordingly we find that they are
continually busied about their lands
if they have any time to spare, they
go immediately to the mountains to
cut wood; to the garden to look to
their herbs, or to cut canes, &amp;c. so
that they are never idle. The land
in China never lies fallow. Generally
the same ground produces three crops
in a year; first rice; and before it is
reaped they sow fitches; and when
they are in, wheat, beans, or some
other grain: thus it goes continually
round. They very seldom employ
their land for unprofitable uses, such
as flower gardens, or fine walks; believing
useful things more for the
public good, and their own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span></p>

<p>The attention of husbandmen is
chiefly employed in the cultivation of
rice. They manure their land extremely
well; gathering for that purpose,
with extraordinary care, all sorts
of ordure, both of men and animals,
or truck for it wood, herbs, or linseed
oil. This kind of manure, which elsewhere
would burn up the plants, is
very proper for the lands of China;
where they have an art of tempering
it with water before they use it. They
gather the dung in pails, which they
commonly carry covered on their
shoulders; and this contributes very
much to the cleanness of their cities,
whose filth is thus taken away every
day.</p>

<p>In the province of <i>Che-Kyang</i>, and
other places, where they sow rice,
they use balls of hog's, or even human
hair; which, according to them, gives
strength to the land, and makes that
grain grow better. For this reason,
Barbers save the hair which they cut
off the heads, and sell for about a halfpenny
a pound to such people, who
carry it away in bags; and you may
often see barks loaded with it. When
the plant begins to ear, if the land be
watered with spring water, they mix
quicklime with it; saying that it kills
worms and insects, destroys weeds,
and gives a warmth to the ground,
which contributes much to fertility.
By this means the rice fields are so
clean, that Navarette, sometimes,
walked through them, looking for
some small herb; and could never
find any; so that he concludes, the
rice which is surprisingly tall and
fine, draws all the nourishment from
the ground.</p>

<p>The husbandmen sow their grain
at first without any order; but when
it has shot about a foot, or a foot and
a half high, they pluck it up by the
roots; and making it into a sort of
small sheaves, plant it by a line, and
checkerwise; to the end, that ears,
resting upon each other, may stand
more firmly, and resist the winds.&mdash;But,
before the rice is transplanted,
they level the land, and make it very
smooth, after the following manner.
Having ploughed the ground three
or four times successively, always to
the ancles in water, they break the
clods with the head of their mattocks;
then, by the help of a wooden
machine (on which a man stands upright,
and guides the buffalo that
draws it) they smooth the earth, that
the water may be every where of an
equal height; insomuch that the
plains seem more like vast gardens
than open fields.</p>

<p>The mountains in China are all
cultivated; but one sees neither
hedges nor ditches, nor scarce any
tree; so fearful they are of loosing
an inch of ground. It is very agreeable
to behold, in some places, plains
three or four leagues in length, surrounded
with hills and mountains, cut
from bottom to top, into terraces three
or four feet high, and rising one above
another, sometimes to the number of
twenty or thirty. These mountains
are not generally rocky, as those in
Europe, the soil being light and porous,
and so easy to be cut in several
provinces, that one may dig three or
four hundred feet without meeting
with the rock. When the mountains
are rocky, the Chinese loosen the
stones, and make little walls of them
to support the terraces; they then
level the good soil and sow it with
grain.</p>

<p>They are still more industrious.&mdash;Though
in some provinces, there be
barren and uncultivated mountains,
yet the valleys and fields which separate
them in a vast number of places,
are very fruitful and well cultivated.
The husbandman first levels all the
unequal places that are capable of
culture. He then divides that part
of the land, which is on the same level,
into plots; and that along the
edges of the valleys, which is unequal,
into stories, in form of an amphitheatre:
and as the rice will not thrive
without water, they make reservoirs,
at proper distances, and different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
heights, to catch the rain and the water
which descends from the mountains,
in order to distribute it equally
among their rice plots; either by letting
it run down from the reservoir
to the plots below, or causing it to
ascend from the lower reservoir to
the highest stories.</p>

<p>For this purpose they make use of
certain hydraulic engines, which are
very simple, both as to their make
and the manner of playing them. It
is composed of a chain made of wood,
resembling a chaplet or pair of beads,
strung as it were with a great number
of flat boards, six or seven inches
square, and placed parallel at equal
distances. This chain passes through
a square tube or gutter: at the lower
end whereof is a smooth cylinder or
barrel, whose axis is fixed in the two
sides: and to the upper end is fastened
a sort of drum, set round with little
boards to answer those of the chain,
which passes round both it and the
cylinder; so that when the drum is
turned, the chain turns also; and,
consequently, the lower end of the
gutter or tube being put into the
water, and the drum-end set to the
height where the water is to be conveyed,
the boards filling exactly the
cavity of the tube, must carry up a
continual stream so long as the machine
is in motion; which is performed
in three ways:&mdash;1st. With the
hand, by means of one or two handles
applied to the ends of the axis of the
drum.&mdash;2nd. With the feet, by means
of certain large wooden pegs, about
half a foot long, set round the axle-tree
of the drum for that purpose.&mdash;These
pegs have long heads, rounded
on the outside, for applying the
soles of the naked feet; so that one
or more men, may with the greatest
ease put the engine in motion, either
standing or sitting; their hands
being employed all the while, the one
holding an umbrella, and the other a
fan.&mdash;3rd. By the assistance of a buffalo,
or some other animal made fast
to a great wheel, about four yards in
diameter, placed horizontally. Round
its circumference are fixed a great
number of pegs or teeth; which tallying
exactly with those in the axle-tree
of the drum, turn the machine
with a great deal of ease.</p>

<p>When a canal is to be cleansed,
which often happens,&mdash;it is divided, at
convenient distances, by dikes; and
every neighbouring village, being allotted
its share, the peasants immediately
appear with their chain-engines;
whereby the water is conveyed from
one to the other. This labour, though
painful, is soon ended, by means of
the multitudes of hands. In some
parts, as the province of <i>Fo-Kyen</i>, the
mountains, though not very high, are
contiguous, and with scarce any valleys
between; yet they are all cultivated
by the art which the husbandmen
have to convey the water from
one to the other through pipes made
of bamboo.</p>

<p>To this surprizing industry of the
husbandmen, is owing that great
plenty of grain and herbs, that reigns
in China above all other regions. Notwithstanding
which, the land hardly
suffices to support its inhabitants; and
one may venture to say, that to live
comfortably they have need of a country
as large again.</p>

<h2>REMARKS ON SALT AS A MANURE.</h2>


<p>The progress of agriculture has
been, and no doubt will continue to
be, proportionate to the advancement
of the science of chymistry; and the
absolute necessity of calling in the aid
of this science to that of agriculture,
will be perfectly evident, when we
reflect, that whenever any substance
is applied to the soil, it becomes very
frequently changed into new matter
by combination or decomposition.&mdash;When
a handful of salt is thrown upon
some soils, its nature is in a very
short time changed, and it becomes a
new substance, which may be useful
or injurious to vegetation, according
to the change which it has undergone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
Hence originates the great diversity
of opinion, relative to the use of salt
as a manure, a subject which the science
of chymistry would set at rest,
after a few simple experiments, but
which the practice of agriculture
would never determine without the
knowledge of the effect of the soil, on
the salt. There are also other considerations
which materially affect the
value in which this article is held as
a manure. The farmers in Cornwall,
in England, use the salt in which fish
has been cured, by which the salt has
already been partially changed, by
combining it with the ammonia of the
fish, which is one of the most powerful
fertilizers known to chymical science.
The practice also of using sea
sand, in the same shire, is attended
with effects which are as much owing
to the use of the sand as the salt.&mdash;The
astonishing effect produced by
the urine of cattle, in Flanders, is no
evidence in favour of salt, [as the
urine contains twelve or thirteen fertilizing
saline substances, besides salt]
but it is a very powerful one in favour
of compound saline manures. Salt
is used in one of the preparations for
the Patent Plaster, or Fertilizing Compost,
but it is in that case combined
with quicklime, and its eventual product
is the muriate of lime and soda,
both of which, when combined with
other substances, are powerful fertilizers.</p>

<p>It appears to be a provision of nature,
that the muriate of soda, or common
salt, should be a neutral substance
with respect to fertilizing the
soil. For if it possessed any degree
of fertilizing powers, its effect would
be seen on our sea-coasts; and its utility,
by this time, would have been
decisively proved by experiment as
well as accident. That salt is partially
beneficial to some soils, is beyond a
doubt; but whether the benefit is
equivalent to the expense of using it,
is a question which can only be determined
by the nature of the soil.&mdash;Wherever
lime is used as a manure,
salt may be beneficially applied, or
when combined with any fertilizing
substance which has a tendency to decompose
it, but in this case the fertilizing
power is owing to the new
product, and not to the muriate of
soda.</p>

<h2>THE LOCUST TREE.</h2>


<p>A writer in the Long Island Star,
highly recommends the cultivation of
the Locust Tree, as a profitable business.
He says the price of this timber
is about seventy-five cents per
cubic foot&mdash;that 200 trees will grow
on an acre of land&mdash;or 20,000 trees
to a hundred acres, which may average
20 feet per tree, which would
give the enormous sum of $300,000.
But suppose they amount to only
$100,000, as the nett profits from 100
acres, in what way can the landholder
expect so great a profit in 30 years,
with the same probability of success,
as from this? He mentions, that the
timber, the seeds of which were planted
by one man in England, was sold
for 60,000<i>l.</i> sterling.</p>

<p>The locust becomes valuable in 15
years after planting, and in 25 or 30
years of full growth. It is easily raised
by planting 15 or 20 trees to the
acre; and as soon as the roots have
spread, running a plough through the
ground, and when it cuts the roots,
new shoots will spring up.</p>

<p>This tree also invites the grass to
grow under it, and the shade does not
materially injure it; and while grass
in the field is burnt up by the scorching
rays of the sun, the locust grove
will yield a rich and luxuriant pasture.</p>

<h2>MEMOIRS OF RICHARD L. EDGEWORTH,
Esq.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h2>


<p>The first volume contains such part
of the memoirs of Mr Edgeworth as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
was written by himself, and is of a
very different complexion from the
second from the pen of his daughter.
We see in every page of the former,
evidence of that abundance of animal
spirits, and healthy activity of body
and mind, which often changed their
channel of direction in the course of
his life, without ever relaxing their
innate spring, or losing any of their
pristine force of impulse. It is indeed
Mr. Edgeworth's boast, corroborated
by his daughter's testimony, that he
was unchanged by age, or events.&mdash;He
seems to have had a ready and
quick feeling for every thing that
happened, just as the bulrush has a
rapid sympathy with the breeze that
passes over it, and raises its head exactly
into its old position the instant
it is gone by. Mr. Edgeworth began
to marry at twenty, and continued the
practice till late in life. In fact, matrimony
and mechanics seem to have
monopolized his fidelity: with dancing
he was desperately enamoured
at first, but his taste soon tired of it,
though he is careful to assure us his
legs never did. Gambling and dissipated
companions possessed him for
a time, but neither sullied his mind,
nor permanently influenced his habits.
Telegraphs and one-wheeled chaises,
however, kept stronger hold of him:
he was the first to send poetry across
the channel by a chain of signals; and
he contrived for himself a carriage in
which his "<em>legs were warned to lift
themselves up</em>," to escape being broken
by posts, and in which he sat
"<em>pretty safe</em> from wet," his feet being
"secured by leathers which folded
up like the sides of bellows."</p>

<p>One of his exploits in this commodious
vehicle, he records in a tone of
exultation with which we entirely
sympathize:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On my road to Birmingham, I
passed through Long-Compton, in
Warwickshire, on a Sunday. The
people were returning from church,
and numbers stopped to gaze at me.
There is or was a shallow ford near
the town, over which there was a
very narrow bridge for horse and foot
passengers, but not sufficiently wide
for wagons or chaises. Towards this
bridge I drove. The people, not
perceiving the structure of my one-wheeled
vehicle, called to me with
great eagerness to warn me, that the
bridge was too narrow for carriages.
I had an excellent horse, which went
so fast as to give but little time for
examination. The louder they called,
the faster I drove, and when I had
passed the bridge, they shouted after
me with surprise. I got on to Shipton
upon Stour; but, before I had
dined there, I found that my fame had
overtaken me. My carriage was put
into a coach-house, so that those who
came from Long-Compton, not seeing
it, did not recognize me; I therefore
had an opportunity of hearing all the
exaggerations and strange conjectures,
which were made by those who
related my passage over the narrow
bridge. There were posts on the
bridge, to prevent, as I suppose, more
than one horseman from passing at
once. Some of the spectators asserted,
that my carriage had gone over
these posts; others said that it had
not <em>wheels</em>, which was indeed literally
true; but they meant to say that it
was without any wheel. Some were
sure that no carriage ever went so
fast; and all agreed, that at the end
of the bridge, where the floods had
laid the road for some way under
water, my carriage swam on the surface
of the water."</p>

<p>Mr. Edgeworth was also, about the
commencement of his career in mechanics,
lucky enough to contrive a
wheel which "should carry on a man
<em>as fast as he could possibly walk</em>,"
that is to say, provided he "<em>plied his
legs with energy</em>." On the first experiment
being made, it answered its
purpose so well as to give the lad
within scarcely time "<em>to jump from
his rolling prison before it reached
the chalk-pit</em>; but the wheel went on
with such velocity as to outstrip its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
pursuers, and rolling over the edge
of the precipice it was dashed to
pieces."</p>

<p>To recompense himself for this
misfortune, he invented "<em>a sailing
carriage</em>."</p>

<p>"The carriage was light, steady,
and ran with amazing velocity. One
day when I was preparing for a sail in
it, with my friend and schoolfellow,
Mr. William Foster, my wheel-boat
escaped from its moorings, just as we
were going to step on board. With
the utmost difficulty I overtook it,
and as I saw three or four stage
coaches on the road, and feared that
this sailing chariot might frighten
their horses, I, at the hazard of my
life, got into my carriage while it was
under full sail, and then, at a favourable
part of the road, I used the means
I had of guiding it easily out of the
way. But the sense of the mischief
which must have ensued, if I had not
succeeded in getting into the machine
at the proper place, and stopping it
at the right moment was so strong, as
to deter me from trying any more experiments
on this carriage in such a
dangerous place. Such should never
be attempted except on a large common,
<em>at a distance from a high road</em>.
It may not however be amiss to suggest,
that upon a large extent of iron
rail-way, in an open country, carriages
properly constructed, might make
profitable voyages from time to time
with sails instead of horses; for though
a constant or regular intercourse could
not be thus carried on, yet goods of a
certain sort, that are saleable at any
time, might be stored till wind and
weather were favourable."</p>

<p>One more of Mr. Edgeworth's ingenious
inventions is all we can allow
to this subject:&mdash;he offered for a wager
to produce a <em>wooden horse that
should carry him safely over the highest
wall in the country</em>!</p>

<p>"It struck me, that, if a machine
were made with eight legs, four only
of which should stand upon the ground
at one time; if the remaining four
were raised up into the body of the
machine, and if this body were divided
into two parts, sliding, or rather rolling
on cylinders, one of the parts, and
the legs belonging to it, might in two
efforts be projected over the wall by
a person in the machine; and the legs
belonging to this part might be let
down to the ground, and then the
other half of the machine might have
its legs drawn up, and be projected
over the wall, and so on alternately.
This idea by degrees developed itself
in my mind, so as to make me perceive,
that as one half of the machine
was always a road for the other half,
and that such a machine never rolled
upon the ground, a carriage might be
made, which should carry a road for
itself. It is already certain, that a
carriage moving on an iron rail-way
may be drawn with a fourth part of
the force requisite to draw it on a
common road. After having made a
number of models of my machine,
that should carry and lay down its own
road. <em>I took out a patent to secure
to myself the principle</em>; but the term
of my patent has been long since expired,
without my having been able to
unite to my satisfaction in this machine
strength with sufficient lightness,
and with regular motion, so as
to obtain the advantages I proposed.
As an <em>encouragement to perseverance</em>,
I assure my readers, that I never lost
sight of this scheme during <em>forty
years</em>; that I have made considerably
above <em>one hundred</em> working models
upon this principle, in a great variety
of forms; and that, <em>although I have
not yet been able to accomplish my
project, I am still satisfied that it is
feasible</em>."</p>

<p>Justice, however, will not permit
us to go to other matters contained
in these most entertaining biographical
notices, without cautioning the
reader not to take the standard of the
utility and intelligence of Mr. Edgeworth's
mechanical pursuits, from
these specimens of his achievements
in this line. He effected much of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
more useful nature, and appears to
have had very considerable talent in
his way&mdash;but so in fact had <em>King
Corny</em>.</p>

<p>Mr. Edgeworth's first marriage was
the only unsuitable one of the several
it was his fortune to make; and not
finding his wife cheerful at home, he
says, led him to seek cheerful company
abroad. In fact, before the death
of his father, we find him quite involved
in the vortex of dissipation and
fashion. His picture of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau
monde</i> of those times is not without
its charm. "Among the ladies who
visited the Mrs. Blakes, was a Miss
Dalton, the famous "Fanny, blooming
fair," whom Lord Chesterfield has
celebrated. He was ingenious enough
to detect the legerdemain tricks of
the "celebrated Comus." Miss D.
told him that her relation, the famous
Sir Francis Blake Delaval, had also
discovered these secrets, and believed
himself to be the only man in England
who possessed them. This
brought about an acquaintance, or
rather intimacy, between Mr. Edgeworth
and Sir Francis, from the description
of the incidents of which we
derive much amusement. They arranged
together the house in Downing
street, where Sir Francis lived,
for the representation of conjuring
tricks.</p>

<p>"The ingenuity of some of the
contrivances, that were employed in
our deceptions, attracted the notice
not only of those who sought mere
amusement, but of men of letters and
science, who came to our exhibitions.
This circumstance was highly grateful
to Sir Francis, and advantageous
to me. I, by these means, became
acquainted with many men of eminence,
to whom I could not at any
period of my life have otherwise obtained
familiar access. Among the
number were Dr. Knight, of the British
Museum: Dr. Watson; Mr. Wilson;
Mr. Espinasse, the electrician;
Foote, the author and actor, a man,
who, beside his well known humour,
possessed a considerable fund of real
feeling; Macklin, and all the famous
actors of the day. They resorted to
a constant table, which was open to
men of genius and merit in every department
of literature and science.&mdash;I
cannot say that his guests were always
"unelbowed by a player;" but
I can truly assert, that none but those
who were an honour to the stage, and
who were admitted into the best company
at other houses, were received
at Sir Francis Delaval's.</p>

<p>They got up the tragedy of the
Fair Penitent here, to allow the late
Duke of York, who afterwards died
suddenly at Rome, to play Lothario;
and "he was as warm, as hasty, and
as much in love, as the fair Calista
could possibly wish." A pleasant
supper-party, he says, they had at the
King's Arms, Covent Garden, after
the performance.</p>

<p>"Macklin called for a nightcap,
and threw off his wig. This, it was
whispered to me, was a signal of his
intention to be entertaining. Plays,
play-wrights, enunciation, action, every
thing belonging to eloquence of
every species, was discussed. Angelo,
the graceful fencing-master, and Bensley,
the actor, were of the party.&mdash;Angelo
was consulted by Bensley, on
what he ought to do with his hands
while he was speaking. Angelo told
him, that it was impossible to prescribe
what he should always do with
them; but that it was easy to tell him
what should <em>not</em> be done&mdash;"he should
not put them into his breeches' pockets"&mdash;a
custom to which poor Bensley
was much addicted. Pronunciation
was discussed; the faults in our
language in this particular were copiously
enumerated. "For instance,"
said Macklin, "<em>Pare</em> me a <em>pair</em> of
<em>pears</em>." You may take three words
out of this sentence, of the same
sound, but of different meanings, and
I defy any man to pronounce them in
such a manner as to discriminate the
sounds, or to mark to any ear by his
pronunciation the difference between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
the verb <em>to pare</em>, the noun of number,
<em>a pair</em>, and the fruit, <em>pear</em>. The pompous
Bensley undertook that Powel,
who was remarkable for a good ear,
should do this. Bensley, who mouthed
prodigiously whilst he spoke, was
put behind a curtain, that the motion
of his lips might not assist Powel in
judging what meaning he intended to
express by each of the words as he
pronounced them. One of the company
was placed behind the curtain,
and to him Bensley was previously to
communicate, whether he proposed
to pronounce the word denoting the
action, the noun of number, or the
fruit. Bensley failed so often, and so
ridiculously, that he became quite angry,
and charged Powel with wilful
misapprehension. To defend himself,
Powel proposed that Holland
should try his skill; but Holland had
no better success. During these trials,
I concerted by signs with Sir
Francis, a method of pointing out my
meaning, and I offered to try my skill.
The audience with difficulty restrained
their contempt: but I took my
place behind the curtain, and they
were soon compelled to acknowledge,
that I had a more distinct pronunciation,
or that Sir Francis had more
acute hearing, than the rest of the
company. Out of twenty experiments,
I never failed more than two
or three times, and in these I failed on
purpose, to prevent suspicion. I had
made my confederate understand, that
when I turned my right foot outward,
as it appeared from beneath the curtain,
I meant to say <em>pare</em>, to cut;
when I turned inward, <em>pair</em>, a couple;
and when it was straight forward, <em>pear</em>,
the fruit. We kept our own counsel,
and won unmerited applause. Amidst
such trifling as this, much sound criticism
was mixed, which improved my
literary taste, and a number of entertaining
anecdotes were related, which
informed my inexperienced mind with
knowledge of the world."</p>

<p>One of the many excellent anecdotes
which Mr. Edgeworth introduces
relative to the extraordinary man
of the town with whom he was now
passing his time, we shall give as a
sample. Sir Francis had contrived to
represent the borough of Andover, in
several Parliaments, by practising a
series of tricks on his constituents:&mdash;but
at length, he sustained a reverse
of fortune, and his electioneering success
terminated.</p>

<p>His attorney's bill was yet to be
discharged. It had been running on
for many years; and though large
sums had been paid on account, a prodigious
balance still remained to be
adjusted. The affair came before the
King's Bench. Among a variety of
exorbitant and monstrous charges,
there appeared the following article.</p>

<p>"To being thrown out of the window
at the George Inn, Andover&mdash;to
my leg being thereby broken&mdash;to surgeon's
bill, and loss of time and business&mdash;all
in the service of Sir F. B.
Delaval.&mdash;Five hundred pounds.</p>

<p>"When this curious <em>item</em> came to
be explained, it appeared, that the attorney
had, by way of promoting Sir
Francis' interest in the borough, sent
cards of invitation to the officers of a
regiment in the town, in the name of
the mayor and corporation, inviting
them to dine and drink his Majesty's
health on his birthday. He, at the
same time, wrote a similar invitation
to the mayor and corporation, in the
name of the officers of the regiment.
The two companies met, complimented
each other, eat a good dinner, drank
a hearty bottle of wine to his Majesty's
health, and prepared to break up.&mdash;The
commanding officer of the regiment,
being the politest man in company,
made a handsome speech to
Mr. Mayor, thanking him for his hospitable
invitation and entertainment.
"No, Colonel," replied the mayor,
"it is to you that thanks are due by
me and by my brother aldermen for
your generous treat to us." The
colonel replied with as much warmth
as good breeding would allow: the
mayor retorted with downright anger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
swearing that he would not be choused
by the bravest colonel in his Majesty's
service.&mdash;"Mr. Mayor," said the colonel,
"there is no necessity for displaying
any vulgar passion on this
occasion. Permit me to show you,
that I have here your obliging card
of invitation."&mdash;"Nay, Mr. Colonel,
here is no opportunity for bantering,
there is your card."</p>

<p>Upon examining the cards, it was
observed, that notwithstanding an attempt
to disguise it, both cards were
written in the same hand by some
person, who had designed to make
fools of them all. Every eye of the
corporation turned spontaneously upon
the attorney, who, of course, attended
all public meetings. His impudence
suddenly gave way, he faltered
and betrayed himself so fully
by his confusion, that the colonel, in
a fit of summary justice, threw him
out of the window. For this Sir
Francis Delaval was charged five
hundred pounds.&mdash;Whether he paid
the money of not, I forget."</p>

<h2>THE PROMPTER.</h2>


<p class="center"><i>It will do for the present.</i></p>

<p>This common saying does as much
mischief in society, as <em>rum</em> or a <em>pestilence</em>.
If I hear a man, whether a
farmer, a mechanic, or any other person,
often repeat that saying, and appear
to act from the opinion, that <em>it
will do for the present</em>, I rely on it he
is a sloven, a drone, or something
worse. I never knew such a man
thrive.</p>

<p>A young man setting out in life, is
in haste to be married. He wants a
house to live in, but is not fully able
to build one. Yet his pride requires
a large showy house. At last, between
poverty and pride, he determines to
build a large house, but not to finish
it till he is <em>more able</em>. He sets up a
large two story house, with four rooms
in a story&mdash;he covers it and paints it:
this is a showy house&mdash;his pride exults
to see passengers stare at his
elegant house: but though <em>pride</em> governs
the <em>outside</em>, <em>poverty</em> reigns
<em>within</em>&mdash;he can finish but two rooms,
half finish one or two more&mdash;and lay
a loose floor above, to spread his corn
upon: this elegant mansion house
then is a granary&mdash;a corn house: the
man and a litter of children below&mdash;and
rats and mice above: but the man
says, <em>it will do for the present</em>. True,
but the man has but twenty or thirty
acres of land, or an indifferent trade&mdash;his
family grows faster than his income&mdash;he
is not able to finish his
house&mdash;the covering soon decays and
admits water&mdash;the house falls to pieces&mdash;the
man is forced <em>poor</em> into the
wilderness, or he and his children
loiter about, dependant on the neighbours
for subsistence by day labour.</p>

<p>I know one of these <em>do-for-the-present-farmers</em>,
who never effectually
repairs his fences; but when a
breach is made, he fills it with a bush
that a sheep may remove: if a rail is
broke, and another is not at hand, he
takes the next billet of wood, inserts
one end into the post, and ties up the
other with elm or hickory bark&mdash;he
says, <em>this will do for the present</em>. His
cattle learn to be unruly&mdash;to remedy
the evil, fetters, shackles, clogs, yokes,
and what he calls <em>pokes</em>, are invented&mdash;and
his cattle and horses are doomed
to hobble about their pasture with
a hundred weight of wood or iron
machines upon their feet and necks.
The man himself, in two years, spends
time enough in patching up his fences
and making fetters, to make a
good effectual fence round his whole
farm, which would want very little
repair in twenty years.</p>

<p>In family affairs, these <em>do-for-the-present
folks</em> double their necessary
labour. They labour hard to put
things <em>out of order</em>, and then it requires
nearly the same work to put
them into order again. A man uses
an axe, a hoe, a spade, and throws it
down where he uses it; instead of
putting it in its proper place, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
cover. Exposed to the weather, tools
do not last more than half so long, as
when kept housed; but this is not all:
a sloven leaves the tool where he last
used it&mdash;or throws it down any where
at random: in a few days he wants it
again&mdash;he has forgot where he left it&mdash;he
goes to look for it&mdash;he spends perhaps
half an hour in search of it, or
walks a distance to get it: this time
is lost, for it breaks in upon some
other business&mdash;the loss of this small
portion of time appears trifling; but
slovens and sluts incur such losses
every day; and the loss of these little
scraps of time determine a man's fortune.
Let the Prompter make a little
calculation: a farmer, whose family
expends one hundred pounds a
year, if he can clear ten pounds a
year is a thriving man. In order to
get his one hundred and ten pounds,
suppose he labours ten hours a day:
in this case, if he loses an <em>hour</em> every
day, in repairing the carelessness of
the day before (and every sloven and
slut loses more time than this, every
day, for want of care and order) he
loses a <em>tenth</em> part of his time&mdash;a <em>tenth</em>
part of his income&mdash;this is <em>eleven
pounds</em>. Such a man cannot thrive&mdash;he
must grow poorer, for want of
<em>care</em>, of <em>order</em>, of <em>method</em>.</p>

<p>So it is with a woman. A neat
woman who does business thoroughly,
keeps things <em>in order</em>, with about
<em>half the labour</em> that a slut employs
who keeps things for ever <em>out of order</em>.
If a pail or kettle be used, it is
directly made clean, fit for other uses,
and put in its place. When it is
wanted, it is ready. But a slut uses
an article and leaves it <em>any where</em>,
dirty, unfit for use another time: by
and by it is wanted, and cannot be
found&mdash;"Moll, where did you leave
the kettle?" "I han't had the kettle,
Nab had it last"&mdash;"Nab, did you have
the kettle?" "Yes, but it is dirty."
So the kettle is found, but it is a half
hour's work to fit it for the purpose
required; in the mean time, the necessary
business must lie by. Yet
this woman says, when she does any
thing, <em>it will do for the present</em>.</p>

<p>I have only to add, that I went to
church, on a late cold Sunday, when
a neighbouring clergyman officiated.
He had spoken to his <em>fifteenthly</em>,
when the clock struck <em>one</em>. Every
man was shivering with the cold, and
shuffling his feet&mdash;the parson took
the hint, and broke off with "<em>this
will do for the present</em>."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>STAPLES OF MISSOURI.</h2>


<p>1. <i>Lead.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Missouri</span> is famed
throughout Europe and America,
for the extent and value of her lead
mines. She would be able to furnish
all the U. States, the West Indies,
Mexico, and South America, with
that article. In the meantime, the
U. States are purchasing lead from
England! About $500,000 per annum
is usually paid by Americans to
Englishmen for lead; last year, however,
it was about $300,000. The
difference of the policy pursued by
the two nations, is the cause of this
state of things. In England, foreign
lead pays a duty of 26<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> sterling
on every quantity of 100<i>l.</i> worth
imported; and the lead mines are
private property. In America, foreign
lead pays but little duty, and
the mines are monopolized by the
government.</p>

<p>2. <i>Iron.</i>&mdash;Missouri has a great interest
in the production of domestic
iron. She possesses immense beds
of ore, exceedingly rich, and well
situated to be worked, and conveniently
transported to all parts of the
valley of the Mississippi. The waters
of the Merrimac, and of the Gasconade
are the chief seats of this ore,
although it is found in many other
parts of the territory, and in such
amazing quantities, that it may be
considered to be for ever inexhaustible.
Missouri could furnish not only
herself and immediate neighbours,
but the whole valley of the Mississippi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
with iron and its manufactures, yet
she is purchasing these articles from
England, Sweden and Russia!</p>

<p>3. <i>Salt.</i>&mdash;-The state of Missouri
abounds with salt springs. In many
places they are almost as common as
fresh water springs. They are found
in every section of the country, but
especially in the Boon's-lick district,
and on the waters of Salt River, a
branch of the Mississippi. Missouri
would be able to furnish an empire
with salt, but heretofore she has purchased
that article from the Illinois
and Kenawha, from Liverpool, St.
Ubes, and Turk's Island!&mdash;The government
monopoly was one cause of
this. Since the purchase of Louisiana
the government had reserved the salt
springs; but in the bill for admitting
Missouri into the Union, 12 springs,
to be chosen by the Legislature, with
four sections of land around each, are
to be given to the state; and the remainder
will probably be sold out,
and become private property. These
springs will be a source of wealth to
the people, and of revenue to the
state. With a judicious system of
management, the whole expenses of
the state government may possibly
be defrayed from the rents and profits
accruing from 12 selected springs.</p>

<p>4. <i>Hemp.</i>&mdash;The soil and the climate
of Missouri, announce it to be
the true country for the production
of hemp. Experience establishes the
fact. Many farmers have raised it,
as well under the Spanish as under
the American government. The
quantity obtained from an acre is prodigious,
and by experiments made at
New Orleans, under the auspices of
the Governor General, the Baron de
Carondelet, it was proved to be equal
(the account says superior) in strength
and fineness of fibre, to the boasted
hemp of Russia. Persons who have
looked to the resources of Missouri
have always considered hemp as one
of its staples, and the encouragement
of its growth one of the first objects
of our farmers and statesmen.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h2>SPEECH NATURAL TO MAN.</h2>


<p>In your paper some time past I
saw an account of "a wild woman
found in the interior of Java." History
furnishes many instances of these
"unfortunate commoners of nature,"
who have been exposed by design or
accident. Comparatively few, we
fear, have been brought to the domestic
hearth; fewer still have been
completely civilized. A book of travels,
now almost obsolete, states instances
of this kind. A race of marauding
Tartars, subjects of Russia,
frequently attacked Polish villages,
and carried off whole families: in
conveying their captives home they
had to pass the wild and intricate forest
of Minsk, in Russian Lithuania,
and there these unfortunate mothers
lost, and were separated from, their
children. In after days, when this
stupendous region was traversed
for other purposes than the nefarious
one above mentioned, several
human males were found, in almost
as barbarous a state as the native
burghers of the forest, to whose ferocious
instinct many of these innocents
had doubtless fallen a prey.</p>

<p>Peter, the Wild Boy, excited much
interest in his day. George the 2d,
of England, found him whilst hunting
in the woods near Hamelin, in the
electorate of Hanover. Peter, when
found, ran on all fours, like the quadrupeds
amongst whom he had been
raised. We might ask, why did the
brutes of prey in this as well as other
instances, deviate from the voracious
instinct planted in their nature? To
accident we cannot refer it; and,
after wearying our minds with conjecture,
we can only end the difficulty by
attributing it to that providential care
which preserved Daniel in the lion's
den. Peter never could be taught to
articulate more than two words&mdash;his
own name and George; but he learned,
with facility and correctness, the
notes of several tunes.</p>

<p>Lord Monboddo, of eccentric memory,
mentions in his narrative respecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
Peter, that two children had
been found in the same wild state&mdash;one
in the island of Diego Garcia,
and one in the Pyrenees. He also
states that two wild children were
found in the Dismal Swamp of Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
This immense morass is yet,
in its inmost recesses, the refuge of
wild animals of prey, particularly
bears, panthers, and wild cats. During
a fire in these swamps, 10 or 12
years ago, numbers were hunted
down, who had fled before the rapid
flames. A resident in that neighbourhood
informed me that he had seen
17 of these animals, some half-burned,
hung upon a single tree. In respect
to the children noticed by Lord
Monboddo, I cannot, in any history
of either Virginia or North Carolina,
find the least hint of such a circumstance
having occurred; nor does the
writer specify the period when they
were found. Is it not probable that
these outcasts from society (admitting
the noble author to be rightly informed)
were the offspring of aboriginal
females, compelled to seek shelter in
these swamps from the invading colonist,
or from some hostile tribe?&mdash;Amongst
the innumerable tribes of
Indians in Virginia and North Carolina,
the <em>Tuskaroras</em> were perhaps
most powerful, and most immediately
in the vicinity of this large tract.
These aborigines were not all dispersed
or destroyed until 1803, some
of them living peaceably on the reserved
lands. The main body of this
tribe of Indians had migrated to New
York state, and joined the Senecas,
(one of the Six Nations,) many years
preceding. Is it not probable, I again
ask, that the young savages of lord
Monboddo did, in fact, inherit the
name from their birth? I would ask,
as a matter of curiosity, of yourselves,
Messrs. Editors, or any of your correspondents,
answers to the following
questions: When were these children
found? Of what age when discovered?
By whom found? What
became of them? Could they be
taught the use of speech?</p>

<p>Lord Monboddo maintains that
speech is not natural to man, and
that the want of it is no proof that
the Ourang-Outang is not of the
same species, as that animal only
wants the <em>artificial</em> use of it. King
John, of England,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> held the same hypothesis
upwards of five centuries
before. Tradition (for such records
are beneath the dignity of history) asserts,
that this monarch imprisoned
two children (a male and female) in
separate cells.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> When, at a certain
age, they were brought before him,
each of these little victims repeated
a sarcasm on his folly in thus confining
them. He considered his hypothesis
as confirmed, but punished
the keepers. The legend is here
torn, and we do not learn (supposing
it true) what became of the children,
or what further progress they made
in language. That man has the power,
as well as the organs of speech, it
appears an absurdity to deny; for,
what country has ever been discovered
where the natives had not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
means of communicating verbally
with each other? In the earliest records
of the world we find no sanction
for such an opinion; for the Antediluvians
were certainly not defective
in the power or use of speech to
convey their ideas. If we deny this we
virtually acknowledge our belief that
the Mosaic account of the creation is
"a cunningly devised fable." After
the Flood we cannot doubt that Noah
and his descendants still spoke the
language of Adam. "All the nations
spoke one language." Lord
Kames contends that, after the building
of Babel, "men again degenerated
into a savage state," which he attributes
to the confusion of tongues,
and the dispersion of the tribes. We
are no where told that they lost or
forgot the use of speech, which lord
Monboddo considers incidental to the
savage state.</p>

<p>Lord Kames appears to take it for
granted that <em>all</em> the men then in existence
were engaged in this stupendous
and impious attempt to scale Heaven,
and "make themselves a name."&mdash;This
idea is not conveyed by the sacred
historian; it therefore appears probable
that the tribes which continued
together still spoke the <em>original language</em>,
and remained in one place, and
as one people. I fear I have trespassed
on your limits, but the subject arose
from the preceding remarks. I conclude
with reiterating my request
respecting the children found in the
Dismal Swamp.</p>

<h2>ARTIFICIAL STONE FLOORS<br />
<span class="s07"><i>and coverings for houses as made
in some parts of Russia</i></span>.</h2>


<p>The floors and coverings of houses
in some parts of South Russia are
made in the following manner:&mdash;For
a floor let the ground be made even,
and some stones of any shape be put
on, and with a heavy wooden rammer
force or break the stones into the
ground, continuing to beat the floor
until it becomes quite even, and incapable
of receiving any further impression.
Then run lime, immediately
after it has been slacked, through a
fine sieve as expeditiously as possible,
because exposure to the air weakens
the lime. Mix two parts of coarse
sand or washed gravel, for there must
be no earth in it, with one part of lime
powder, and wet them with bullock's
blood; so little moist however, as
merely to prevent the lime blowing
away in powder&mdash;in short, the less
moist the better: spread it on the
floor, and without a moment's loss of
time, let several men be ready with
large beetles to beat the mixture,
which will become more and more
moist by the excessive beating requisite.
Then put on it some of the dry
sand and lime mixed, and beat it till
like a stone. If required to be very
fine, take for the next layer finely
sifted lime, with about a tenth part
of rye flour, and a little ox blood;
beat it with a trowel. The next day
again smooth it with a trowel, and so
continue to do daily till it be entirely
dry. When it is quite dry and hard,
rub it over with fresh ox blood, taking
off all which it will not imbibe.
No wet will penetrate this composition,
which, however, after some time
is often painted with oil colours. The
whole floor appears as a single stone,
and nothing will affect it.&mdash;The drier
it is used the better, provided that
with much beating it becomes like a
very stiff mortar, and evidently forms
a compact body.</p>

<p>On flat tops of houses, the beetles
or rammers' ends must be smaller,
to prevent the rebounding of the
boards and timber, which would crack
the cement; but, when the thickness
of a foot is laid on, it will beat more
firmly. A thick coating of ox blood,
flour and lime, being beat in large,
strong wooden troughs, or mortar, till
it can be spread with a trowel, may be
used without beating it again on the
floor or house-top: but it must be
very stiff, and used most expeditiously.
Even frost will not affect it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
With this composition, artificial stone
may be made, rammed very hard into
strong wooden frames of the required
shape, particularly to turn
arches for buildings of rammed earth.
It is well known that earth which is
not too argillaceous, with only the
moisture it has when fresh dug, on
being rammed between frames of
wood till the rammer will no longer
impress it, makes eternal walls; but
a mass as hard as stone may be made
with a little lime added to sand, horse-dung,
or ox blood. The more the
lime is beaten, the moister it becomes,
and it must contain so much
moisture as to become by beating a
solid mass, adhering in all its parts,
and not remain crumbling, that will
properly set as a mortar. If there be
too little moisture at first, it will remain
a powder; if there be too much
it will become a soft mortar. Lime
is of no use mixed with clay or vegetable
earths, which, if well beaten,
are stronger without it.</p>

<p class="center">FROM A LATE ENGLISH PAPER.</p>

<h2>ATTACK BY BEES.</h2>


<p>Some days ago the following singular
narrative appeared in the Berlin
Gazette: it was furnished to that paper
by M. Eulert, a merchant of that
city, who was himself the party principally
concerned:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was travelling," says M. Eulert,
"on the 20th of July, at 7 o'clock in
the morning, in my carriage, accompanied
by my wife, on my way from
Wirtemberg to Berlin, between
Kroppstadt and the town of Schmogelsdorf,
which is contiguous to the
high road; I observed one of my
horses rub himself with uneasiness
against the other. I remarked to my
wife that the animal no doubt was
stung by a horse-fly. Whilst we were
talking upon the subject, we were
suddenly surrounded by a swarm of
bees, so thick, that our carriage
horses, coachman, my wife, and myself,
were completely covered. The
furious insects attached themselves
immediately to the nose, mouth, eyes
and ears of each horse; the two animals
seemed to be deprived of every
sense, and as if overcome with stupor,
they lay down, and stretched themselves
out an unresisting prey to the
bees.</p>

<p>"As soon as we perceived this
cloud of insects to lessen around us,
my wife threw over her hat the hood
of her night cloak, got out of the carriage,
went back a little way on the road,
and instinctively fled into the ditch,
where she lay down with her face to
the earth. I exerted myself in the
meantime in endeavouring to get over
this disaster; I went also out of the
carriage, and covering my face and
neck with my handkerchief, I re-ascended
the carriage, and with all my
strength cried out for help.&mdash;Three
peasants, a short distance off, had all
the while calmly observed my situation;
but neither by the offer of reward,
nor by the most urgent entreaty, could I
prevail upon them to render us any assistance;
they turned their backs upon
us, and pursued their way to the village.
In this unhappy plight I walked
on for half an hour, when I met
the road-keeper, named Daniel Arndt,
and a carrier, named David Henry,
accompanied by some labourers, and
driving a cart with three horses.&mdash;Still
tormented by the bees, and pursued
by them with inconceivable bitterness,
I breathed at last, and was
relieved by this rencontre, as these
good people had lighted tobacco
pipes, and the smoke dispersed my
disagreeable guests.</p>

<p>"The carrier being informed of
the danger, in order not to expose
himself to it, would not stir one pace
further; and as the bees began to
surround us on all sides, he unharnessed
his team, left his cart laden with
goods on the road, and took a by-way
in order to place his horses under
shelter in the village. Soon after the
other people accompanied me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
where my horses were, and they
brought with them an abundance of
hay and straw. There we found my
unfortunate coachman stretched in the
ditch, his head and hands all covered
with bees, so that the road-keeper
was obliged to use a brush to get them
off his face; his hair was matted with
blood, and as the insects could not be
extricated, they were crushed to
death.&mdash;Whilst this operation was
going on, we set fire to the straw, and
succeeded in driving away the bees.</p>

<p>"As soon as the carrier had placed
his horses in safety, he came back to
us having fortified himself in every
way against the bees, and showed himself
anxious to give all the assistance
in his power to my horses.&mdash;But one
of them was so severely injured, that
he died the same day. The other was
conducted to Schmogelsdorf; but
though the veterinary surgeon exhausted
all his skill, the animal perished
in twenty-four hours after.</p>

<p>"My coachman had brought his
misfortune on himself, because, in
endeavouring to succour the horses,
he had lost his hat. The bees fastened
on his naked head, and deprived
him of his senses, and for forty-eight
hours he remained in a state
of suffering that threatened to terminate
in his death. We were supplied
with horses, and had him conveyed to
Treuenbrietzen, where he recovered.
He had at first cried out so vehemently
for assistance, that the bees
got into his mouth and throat. I myself
passed twenty-four hours in extreme
pain at the same place, and
was compelled to apply several poultices,
to my head, neck, and ears, to
appease the inflammation.</p>

<p>"My wife, who, as if by inspiration,
threw herself down into the
ditch, came out again perfectly safe&mdash;and
in a few days after, the coachman
and I were at length entirely recovered.</p>

<p>"I attribute this accident to two
causes. In the first place, I now believe
it was not a horse fly that stung
the horse, as I at first supposed, but
rather the queen bee, which must
have been killed when the animal
rubbed against his companion. I conjecture
this to have been the case,
from the natural history of these insects;
it is very common to see a
swarm of bees, when deprived of
their leading queen, unite with other
swarms, and fall with a species of
madness, upon the first objects they
encounter.</p>

<p>"In the next place, I attribute the
circumstance to the fact, that, contrary
to express prohibition of the
magistrates, the Commune of Schmogelsdorf,
besides its proper number
of 900 hives, takes in an equal number
from the neighbouring communes to
tend during the time of swarming,
because the flowers, fields and gardens
which it contains, present a singularly
rich pasture for such insects.
Hence it happens, that in a small
space nearly two thousand hives are
crowded together, so that in the season
of swarming it is dangerous to
pass that way.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>ZOOLOGY Of THE SPITZBERGEN
WHALE.</h2>

<p class="center">Extracted from Scoresby's valuable work, "Arctic
Voyages," &amp;c. just published.</p>


<p>Erroneous opinions have been entertained
respecting the Whale (the
Balæna Mysticetus) having been of
a much larger size in former times
than now: from a comparison of the
preceding accounts of all credible
witnesses, the author says&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hence I conceive we may satisfactorily
conclude, that whales of as
large size are found now, as at any
former period since the Spitzbergen
fishery was discovered; and I may
also remark, that where any respectable
authority affords actual measurements
exceeding 70 feet, it will always
be found that the specimen referred
to, was not one of the Mysticetus
kind, but of the B. Physalis, or
the B. Musculus, animals which considerably
exceed in length any of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
common whales that I have either
heard of, or met with. When fully
grown, therefore, the length of the
whale may be stated as varying from
50 to 65, and rarely, if ever, reaching
70 feet; and its greatest circumference
from 30 to 40 feet. It is thickest
a little behind the fins, or in the middle,
between the anterior and posterior
extremes of the animal; from whence
it gradually tapers in a conical form,
towards the tail, and slightly towards
the head. Its form is cylindrical from
the neck, to within ten feet of the tail,
beyond which it becomes somewhat
quadrangular, the greatest ridge being
upward, or on the back, and running
backward nearly across the middle of
the tail. The head has somewhat of
a triangular shape. The under-part,
the arched outline of which is given
by the jaw-bones, is flat, and measures
16 to 20 feet in length, and 10 to 12
in breadth. The lips, extending 15
to 20 feet in length, and 5 or 6 in
height, and forming the cavity of the
mouth, are attached to the under-jaw,
and rise from the jaw-bones, at an
angle of about 80 degrees, having the
appearance, when viewed in front, of
the letter U. The upper jaw, including
the 'crown-bone,' or skull, is
bent down at the extremity, so as to
shut the front and upper parts of the
cavity of the mouth, and is overlapped
by the lips in a squamous manner at
the sides. When the mouth is open,
it presents a cavity as large as a room,
and capable of containing a merchant-ship's
jolly-boat, full of men,
being 6 or 8 feet wide, 10 or 12 feet
high (in front), and 15 or 16 feet long.
The fins, two in number, are placed
between one-third and two-fifths of the
length of the animal, from the snout,
and about two feet behind the angle
of the mouth. They are 7 to 9 feet
in length, and 4 or 5 in breadth. The
part by which they are attached to
the body, is somewhat elliptical, and
about 2 feet in diameter; the side
which strikes the water is nearly flat.
The articulation being perfectly spherical,
the fins are capable of motion
in any direction; but, from the tension
of the flesh and skin below, they
cannot be raised above the horizontal
position. Hence the account given
by some naturalists, that the whale
supports its young by its fins, on its
back, must be erroneous. The fins,
after death, are always hard and stiff;
but, in the living animal, it is presumed,
from the nature of the internal
structure, that they are capable of
considerable flexion. The whale has
no dorsal fin. The tail, comprising,
in a single surface, 80 or 100 square
feet, is a formidable instrument of
motion and defence. Its length is
only 5 or 6 feet; but its width is 18
to 24 or 26 feet. Its position is horizontal.
In its form it is flat and semi-lunar;
indented in the middle; the
two lobes somewhat pointed, and
turned a little backward. Its motions
are rapid and universal; its strength
immense. The eyes are situated in
the sides of the head, about a foot obliquely
above and behind the angle of
the mouth. They are remarkably
small in proportion to the bulk of the
animal's body, being little larger than
those of an ox. The whale has no
external ear; not can any orifice for
the admission of sound be discovered
until the skin is removed.</p>

<p>On the most elevated part of the
head, about 16 feet from the anterior
extremity of the jaw, are situated the
blow-holes, or spiracles; consisting of
two longitudinal apertures 6 or eight
inches in length. These are the proper
nostrils of the whale. A moist
vapour, mixed with mucus, is discharged
from them, when the animal
breathes; but no water accompanies
it, unless an expiration of the breath
be made under the surface.</p>

<p>The mouth, in place of teeth, contains
two extensive rows of "fins," or
whalebone, which are suspended from
the sides of the crown-bone. These
series of fins are generally curved
longitudinally, although they are
sometimes straight, and give an arched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
form to the roof of the mouth.&mdash;They
are covered immediately by the
lips attached to the lower jaw, and
enclose the tongue between their
lower extremities. Each series or
"side of bone," as the whalefishers
term it, consists of upwards of 300
laminæ; the longest are near the
middle, from whence they gradually
diminish away to nothing at each extremity.
Fifteen feet is the greatest
length of the whalebone; but 10 or
11 feet is the average size, and 13
feet is a magnitude seldom met with.
The greatest breadth, which is at the
gum, is 10 or 12 inches. The laminæ,
composing the two series of bone,
are ranged side by side, two thirds of
an inch apart, (thickness of the blade
included,) and resemble a frame of
saws, in a saw-mill. The interior
edges are covered with a fringe of
hair, and the exterior edge of every
blade, excepting a few at each extremity
of the series, is curved and flattened
down, so as to present a smooth
surface to the lips. In some whales,
a curious hollow on one side, and
ridge on the other, occurs in many of
the central blades of whalebone, at
regular intervals of 6 or 7 inches.&mdash;May
not this irregularity, like the
rings in the horns of the ox, which
they resemble, afford an intimation of
the age of the whale? If so, twice
the number of running feet in the
longest laminæ of whalebone in the
head of a whale not full grown, would
represent its age in years. In the
youngest whales, called <em>suckers</em>, the
whalebone is only a few inches long;
when the length reaches 6 feet or upwards,
the whale is said to be <em>size</em>.
The colour of the whalebone is
brownish-black, or bluish-black. In
some animals, it is striped longitudinally
with white. When newly
cleaned, the surface exhibits a fine
play of colour. A large whale sometimes
affords a ton and a half of whalebone.
If the "sample blade," that
is, the largest lamina in the series,
weigh 7 pounds, the whole produce
may be estimated at a ton; and so on
in proportion. The whalebone is inserted
into the crown-bone, in a sort
of rabbet. All the blades in the same
series are connected together by the
gum, in which the thick ends are inserted.
This substance, (the gum,)
is white, fibrous, tender, and tasteless.
It cuts like cheese. It has the appearance
of the interior or kernel of
the cocoa-nut.</p>

<p>The tongue occupies a large proportion
of the cavity of the mouth,
and the arch formed by the whalebone.
It is incapable of protrusion,
being fixed from root to tip, to the fat
extending between the jaw-bones.&mdash;A
slight beard, consisting of a short
scattered white hair, surmounts the
anterior extremity of both jaws. The
throat is remarkably strait.</p>

<p>Two paps in the female, afford the
means of rearing its young. The
milk of the whale resembles that of
quadrupeds in its appearance. It is
said to be rich and well-flavoured.</p>

<p>Immediately beneath the skin lies
the <em>blubber</em> or fat, encompassing the
whole body of the animal, together
with the fins and tail. Its colour is
yellowish-white, yellow, or red. In
the very young animal it is always
yellowish-white. In some old animals,
it resembles in colour the substance
of the salmon. It swims in
water. Its thickness all round the
body, is 8 or 10 to 20 inches, varying
in different parts as well as in
different individuals. The lips are
composed almost entirely of blubber,
and yield from one to two tons of pure
oil each. The tongue is chiefly composed
of a soft kind of fat, that affords
less oil than any other blubber; in the
centre of the tongue, and towards the
root, this fat is intermixed with fibres
of a muscular substance. The under
jaw, excepting the two jaw-bones,
consists almost wholly of fat; and the
crown-bone possesses a considerable
coating of it. The fins are principally
blubber, tendons, and bones; and the
tail possesses a thin stratum of blubber.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
The oil appears to be retained
in the blubber in minute cells, connected
together by a strong reticulated
combination of tendinous fibres.
The blubber, in its fresh state, is without
any unpleasant smell; and it is
not until after the termination of the
voyage, when the cargo is unstowed,
that a Greenland ship becomes disagreeable.</p>

<p>Four tons of blubber by measure,
generally afford three tons of oil; but
the blubber of a sucker contains a
very small proportion. Whales have
been caught that afforded nearly thirty
tons of pure oil; and whales yielding
twenty tons of oil, are by no means
uncommon. The quantity of oil yielded
by a whale, generally bears a certain
proportion to the length of its
longest blade of whalebone.</p>

<p>A stout whale of sixty feet in length,
is of the enormous weight of seventy
tons; the blubber weighs about thirty
tons, the bones of the head, whalebone,
fins and tail, eight or ten; carcase
thirty or thirty-two.</p>

<p>The flesh of the young whale is of
a red colour; and when cleared of fat,
broiled, and seasoned with pepper and
salt, does not eat unlike coarse beef;
that of the old whale approaches to
black, and is exceedingly coarse.&mdash;An
immense bed of muscles surrounding
the body, is appropriated
chiefly to the movements of the tail.</p>

<p>The number of ribs, according to
Sir Charles Giesecké, is thirteen on
each side. The bones of the fins are
analogous, both in proportion and
number, to those of the fingers of the
human hand. From this peculiarity
of structure, the fins have been denominated
by Dr. Flemming, "swimming
paws." The posterior extremity
of the whale, however, is a real
tail; the termination of the spine or
coccygis, running through the middle
of it almost to the edge.</p>

<p>The whale seems dull of hearing.
A noise in the air, such as that produced
by a person shouting, is not
noticed by it, though at the distance
only of a ship's length; but a very
slight splashing in the water, in calm
weather, excites its attention, and
alarms it. Its sense of seeing is acute.
Whales are observed to discover one
another, in clear water, when under
the surface, at an amazing distance.
When at the surface, however, they
do not see far. They have no voice;
but in breathing or <em>blowing</em>, they
make a very loud noise. The vapour
they discharge, is ejected to the height
of some yards, and appears at a distance,
like a puff of smoke. When
the animals are wounded, it is often
stained with blood; and, on the approach
of death, jets of blood are
sometimes discharged alone. They
blow strongest, densest, and loudest,
when, "running," when in a state of
alarm, or when they first appear at
the surface, after being a long time
down. They respire or blow about
four or five times a-minute.</p>

<p>The usual rate at which whales
swim, even when they are on their
passage from one situation to another,
seldom exceeds four miles an hour;
and though when urged by the sight of
any enemy, or alarmed by the stroke
of a harpoon, their extreme velocity
may be at the rate of eight or nine
miles an hour: yet we find this speed
never continues longer than for a few
minutes, before it relaxes almost to
one-half. Hence, for the space of a
few minutes, they are capable of darting
through the water, with the velocity
almost of the fastest ship under
sail, and of ascending with such rapidity
as to leap entirely out of the
water. This feat they sometimes
perform as an amusement apparently,
to the high admiration of the distant
spectator; but to the no small
terror of the unexperienced fishers
who, even under such circumstances,
are often ordered, by the foolhardy
harpooner, to "pull away" to the attack.
Sometimes the whales throw
themselves into a perpendicular posture,
with their heads downward, and,
rearing their tails on high in the air,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
beat the water with awful violence.&mdash;In
both these cases, the sea is thrown
into foam, and the air filled with vapours;
the noise, in calm weather, is
heard to a great distance; and the
concentric waves produced by the
concussions on the water, are communicated
abroad to a considerable
extent. Sometimes the whale shakes
its tremendous tail in the air, which,
cracking like a whip, resounds to the
distance of two or three miles.</p>

<p>When it retires from the surface,
it first lifts its head, then plunging it
under water, elevates its back like the
segment of a sphere, deliberately
rounds it away towards the extremity,
throws its tail out of the water, and
then disappears.</p>

<p>In their usual conduct, whales remain
at the surface to breathe, about
two minutes, seldom longer; during
which time, they "blow" eight or
nine times, and then descend for an
interval usually of five or ten minutes;
but sometimes, when feeding, fifteen
or twenty. The depth to which they
commonly descend, is not known,
though from the "eddy" occasionally
observed on the water, it is evidently,
at times, only trifling. But, when
struck, the quantity of line they sometimes
take out of the boats, in a perpendicular
descent, affords a good
measure of the depth. By this rule,
they have been known to descend to
the depth of an English mile; and
with such velocity, that instances have
occurred, in which whales have been
drawn up by the line attached, from
a depth of 700 or 800 fathoms, and
have been found to have broken their
jaw-bones, and sometimes crown-bone,
by the blow struck against the
bottom. Some persons are of opinion,
that whales can remain under a
field of ice, or at the bottom of the
sea, in shallow water, when undisturbed,
for many hours at a time.&mdash;Whales
are seldom found sleeping:
yet, in calm weather, among ice, instances
occasionally occur.</p>

<p>The food of the whale consists of
various species of actiniæ, cliones,
sepiæ, medusæ, cancri, and helices;
or at least some of these genera are
always to be seen whenever any tribe
of whales is found stationary and
feeding. In the dead animals, however,
in the very few instances in
which I have been enabled to open
their stomachs, squillæ or shrimps
were the only substances discovered.
In the mouth of a whale just killed, I
once found a quantity of the same
kind of insect.</p>

<p>When the whale feeds, it swims
with considerable velocity below the
surface of the sea, with its jaws widely
extended. A stream of water consequently
enters its capacious mouth,
and along with it, large quantities
of water insects; the water escapes
again at the sides; but the food is entangled
and sifted as it were, by the
whalebone, which, from its compact
arrangement, and the thick internal
covering of hair, does not allow a particle
the size of the smallest grain to
escape.</p>

<h2>SIR JOSEPH BANKS.</h2>


<p>On Monday morning, June 19,
1820, at 8 o'clock, died, at his house,
Spring Grove, near Hounslow, the
venerable President of the Royal Society,
the Right Hon. Sir Joseph
Banks, G. C. B. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. The
loss to science by the demise of this
excellent man and liberal patron will
be long and severely felt. It will be
recollected, that when it was determined
to send Captain Cook on his first
voyage round the globe, Sir Joseph
Banks, then a young man, whose ardent
mind glowed with a love of science
and of ingenious enterprise, determined
to accompany him. His liberal
spirit and generous curiosity
were regarded with admiration, and
every convenience from the government
was readily supplied to render
the circumstances of the voyage as
comfortable as possible. Far, however,
from soliciting any accommodation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
that might occasion expense to
government, Mr. Banks was ready to
contribute largely out of his own private
fortune towards the general purposes
of the expedition. He engaged
as his director in natural history during
the voyage, and as the companion
of his researches, Dr. Solander,
of the British museum, a Swede by
birth, and one of the most eminent
pupils of Linnæus, whose scientific
merits had been his chief recommendation
to patronage in England. He
also took with him two draughtsmen,
one to delineate views and figures,
the other to paint subjects of natural
history. A secretary and four servants
formed the rest of his suite.
He took care to provide likewise the
necessary instruments for his intended
observations, with convenience for
preserving such specimens as he
might collect of natural or artificial
objects, and with stores to be distributed
in the remote isles he was going
to visit, for the improvement of
the condition of savage life. In the
course of the voyage dangers were
encountered of no ordinary magnitude.
On the coast of Terra del
Fuego in an excursion to view the
natural productions of the country,
Sir Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander
had nearly perished in a storm of
snow. After passing a night on land,
amid the storm, they at last, and with
much difficulty, made their way back
to the beach, and were received on
board the ship; but three of the persons
who accompanied them were
lost. Shortly after his return from
this voyage, Sir Joseph, in company
with his friend Dr. Solander, visited
Iceland. A rich harvest of new
knowledge and of specimens compensated
for the toils and expense of
this scientific adventure. They afterwards
visited the Western Islands of
Scotland: and among other things
worthy of notice, they discovered the
columna stratification of the rocks
surrounding the caves of Staffa; a
phenomenon till then unobserved by
naturalists, but was no sooner made
known in a description by Sir J.
Banks, than it became famous among
men of science throughout Europe.
In 1777, when Sir John Pringle retired
from the presidency of the
Royal Society, Sir Joseph Banks was
elected to fill the vacant chair; and
never perhaps has it been filled with
more honour to the individual, or
more advantage to the interests of
science. His time, his wealth, (which
was a princely fortune,) his influence,
his talents, an incomparable library
of science and art; knowledge and
judgment to advise; affability to conciliate
and encourage; generosity to
assist; all in short of which he possessed,
and it was all something either
of goodness or greatness, he made the
patrimony of the studious and learned,
not of his own country alone, but
of the whole world.</p>

<h2>CURIOUS FACTS IN NATURAL HISTORY.</h2>


<p>The examination of flowers by the
microscope opens a new field of wonder
to the inquiring naturalist; by
which we are enabled to perceive
that the minutest works of Nature are
adorned with the most consummate
elegance and beauty. As one proof,
from innumerable others that might
be selected, I beg to subjoin Sir John
Hill's interesting account of what appeared
on examining a carnation;&mdash;first
published in the Inspector, No.
109. "The principal flower in this
<em>bouquet</em>, was a <em>carnation</em>; the fragrance
of this led me to enjoy it frequently
and nearly: the sense of
smelling was not the only one affected
on these occasions; while that was satiated
with the powerful sweet, the
ear was constantly attacked by an extremely
soft but agreeable murmuring
sound. It was easy to know that
some animal, within the covert, must
be the musician, and that the little
noise must come from some little
body suited to produce it. I instantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
distended the lower part of the flower,
and, placing it in a full light,
could discover troops of little insects
frisking and capering with wild jollity
among the narrow pedestals that supported
its leaves, and the little threads
that occupied its centre! I was not
cruel enough to pull out any one of
them for examination: but adapting
a microscope to take in at one view,
the whole base of the flower, I gave
myself an opportunity of contemplating
what they were about, and this
for many days together without giving
them the least disturbance.&mdash;Thus
could I discover their economy,
their passions and their enjoyments.
The microscope, on this occasion,
had given what nature seemed
to have denied to the objects of contemplation.
The base of the flower
extended itself under its influence to
a vast plain; the slender stems of the
leaves became trunks of so many
stately cedars; the threads in the
middle seemed columns of massy
structure, supporting at the top their
several ornaments; and the narrow
spaces between were enlarged into
walls, paterres, and terraces. On the
polished bottom of these, brighter
than Parian marble, walked in pairs,
alone, or in larger companies, the
winged inhabitants: these from little
dusky flies (for such only the naked
eye would have shown them,) were
raised to glorious glittering animals,
stained with living purple, and with a
glossy gold that would have made all
the labours of the loom contemptible
in the comparison. I could, at leisure
as they walked together, admire
their elegant limbs, their velvet
shoulders, and their silken wings;
their backs vieing with the empyrean
in its blue; and their eyes, each
formed of a thousand others, out-glittering
the little planes on a brilliant;
above description, and too great
almost for admiration. Here were
the perfumed groves, the more than
myrtle shades, of the poet's fancy, realized;
here the little animals spent
their days in joyful dalliance; or in
the triumph of their little hearts,
skipped after one another from stem
to stem among the painted trees; or
winged their short flight to the close
shadow of some broader leaf, to revel
undisturbed in the heights of all
felicity."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>ABSENCE OF MIND.</h2>


<p>Among a number of instances of
the celebrated Dr. Moncey's absence
of mind, is one which he frequently
mentioned, and laughed at heartily,
when in good humour, at the same
time observing that his brother was as
bad as himself. The doctor being
once on a visit to his brother, in Norfolk,
in the beginning of winter, and
intending to set off for London the
next day, his brother proposed to
go and shoot wild ducks early in the
morning, that he might carry two or
three couple fresh killed to London
with him. The servant was ordered
to clean the long fowling piece, get
plenty of powder and shot, and to
goose-grease their boots. Every thing
being in readiness according to their
desire, about an hour before day-light
the doctor and his brother set off for
the place where the ducks resort, in
order to be there by the break of day,
when they generally take wing to go
to feed. They had walked nearly
three miles, and it having rained in
the night, the clay mud wall was very
dirty and greasy, when they heard
the cry of the ducks. They were
now obliged to get over the wall and
the gate, across a sluice into the
marsh where the ducks were. The
rain had raised the water about a foot.
It was then proposed that one should
go over, and the other remain behind.
Says the doctor, "George, do
you go over, for I have forgotten my
boots." "So have I doctor," says
his brother; "but we wont lose our
sport, as we have come so far." So
both waded through, and got over the
gate into the marsh, and advancing
along the fleet, they at length perceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
the ducks. "You are near
enough, George," said the doctor.&mdash;"Aye,"
replied George, "I think we
are not above a hundred yards off."
"Why then fire," says the doctor.&mdash;"Do
you fire," returned George.
"Why I hav'nt got the gun; do you
fire." "I fire! why I have not got
the gun," said his brother, "I thought
you had it. What a fine opportunity
is lost. Here are not less than thirty
ducks within shot, and neither of us
have got the gun."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LIFE-PRESERVER.</h2>


<p>The following simple method of
rescuing drowning persons from a
watery grave, is contained in a long
article on that subject, in a late Liverpool
paper, and is deserving of attention.
The writer says:</p>

<p>If any one estimate inventions in
the inverse ratio of their simplicity,
they will smile to hear that the life-preserver
which I have so highly extolled,
is no more than a <em>hat</em> and <em>pocket
handerchief</em>;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> so that every man has,
at all times, about his person an apparatus
which may be the means of
saving the life of his fellow creature.</p>

<p>With these simple means any man
who can swim may safely venture into
the water, with the certainty of rescuing
a drowning person. All the
preparation, which need not occupy
ten seconds, is this: Spread the handkerchief
out on the ground, and place
the hat upon it in the centre, with
the crown upwards, in the ordinary
position of wearing; then gather up
the four corners of the handerchief
over the crown of the hat, giving it a
few twists for the greater convenience
of grasping with the hand. The hat
must then be inverted, (the crown
downwards.) In this position, it is
confidently asserted, any person may
safely enter the water, as the cavity
of the hat contains, a much greater
quantity of air than is requisite to
sustain any man. I found that the
hat with which I tried the experiment,
would almost support me and
another person clinging to me, neither
of us making the least effort to
float by any motion of the hands and
feet. The mode I should adopt,
however, in using the life-preserver,
would be to give up the handkerchief
to the person whose life was in danger,
and immediately to disengage
myself from him. He would soon
discover that he was buoyed up, and
would recover his presence of mind;
but, whether he did or not, it would
be of little consequence, as long as
he retained his grasp of the handkerchief.
Whilst he was thus supported,
nothing could be more easy than to
push him to the shore with one hand,
swimming with the other.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>JOHN O'GROAT'S HOUSE.</h2>


<p>The place so denominated is still a
land-mark, although the house has
long fallen to decay; so totally so
that not a vestige remains; but the
scite is an object of curiosity to travellers,
for the singularity of the
building, which tradition has preserved
the form of, and the motive for
its erection. In the reign of James
the VIth of Scotland, (James the Ist
of England,) two brothers, named
Malcomb Gavin, and John O'Groat,
arrived in Caithness from Holland,
and it is said brought letters from the
King. They purchased or possessed
themselves of the lands of Warse and
Duningsbay, lying near the Portland
Hills. They increased in course of
time to eight families: here they
lived peaceably and comfortably for
many years, and held an annual feast
to commemorate the landing of their
ancestors. Could it be supposed that
any petty distinctions should have a
tendency to interrupt the family harmony?
but so it was. Each head of
the families contended for the seniority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
and chieftainship of the clan. The
ingenuity of one (a John O'Groat)
settled the dispute for precedency,
which arose upon the importance of
sitting at the head of the table, and
the right of entering first in at the
door! John occupied a ferry, and his
daily intercourse with strangers had
enlarged his ideas: he expostulated
with his clan on the folly of their pretensions,
and represented, that quarrels
amongst themselves would render
them obnoxious to the people
where they had settled. John's reasoning
prevailed, and they agreed to
be guided by him: in due time he
fulfilled his plan to reconcile their
discordant ideas. He built a very
large room in an octagon form, with
eight doors and eight windows in it;
in this room he placed a massy oak
table with eight sides. At the next
anniversary meeting, he requested
each head of the families to enter at
the door most convenient to their
dwelling at the same moment; he
then took the unoccupied seat. The
scite, as has been observed, is still
celebrated, and will be so, whilst good
intentions, and a plain useful understanding,
are considered estimable
qualities. Fully to appreciate this,
we should recollect the deadly feuds
which frequently arose in Scotland in
former days, even on less grounds
than precedency.</p>

<h2>HARTFORD FAIR.</h2>

<p class="center">From the Connecticut Mirror.</p>


<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">To the Executive Committee of the
Hartford County Agricultural Society.
The Committee appointed
to examine Domestic Manufactures,
and award premiums to
those who in their opinion are entitled
to them, respectfully report:</p></blockquote>

<p>That notwithstanding the unpleasant
weather, the articles they were
called to inspect were greater in number,
and in general much superior in
quality to those exhibited last year.</p>

<p>There were some woollen cloths
of a finer texture and finish, than that
which obtained the premium, but a
part of them were not of the requisite
width, and others were dyed in the
piece, while your committee felt it
their duty to give the preference to
cloth dyed in the wool. A piece inferior
to the premium cloth sold for
$2.50 per yard.</p>

<p>It was with much satisfaction that
our committee remarked the improvement
in the manufacture of
Carpeting; last year but one piece
offered for their inspection was filled
with wool, while this year most of
those exhibited were of that description.
They were also gratified to
learn that the premium carpets were
all spun and dyed in the family.</p>

<p>The committee are of opinion that
scarcely any thing submitted to their
examination denotes so rapid an improvement
in taste and domestic industry,
as the hearth rugs&mdash;those
which were this year exhibited displayed
an elegance both in their design
and execution, which in articles
of that kind is rarely met with.</p>

<p>Many of the flannels were of a
quality much superior to those exhibited
last year. A large part of them
sold at from eighty cents to one dollar;
and the premium flannel brought
$1.25 by the piece.</p>

<p>The premium blankets excited universal
attention, and were equally admired
for their beauty and for their
more substantial qualities. We have
never seen any superior to them imported
from England; they measured
nearly twelve quarters, and
sold for $14.25.</p>

<p>The quantity of hosiery was much
greater than at our former exhibition&mdash;many
pairs of stockings sold at
from 80 cents to $1.50.</p>

<p>Premiums were awarded to two
very fine elegant finished grass bonnets,
made by the Miss Woodhouses
of Weathersfield, and which are
rarely surpassed in beauty by the
most costly Leghorns. One very
little inferior was also exhibited, made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
by Miss Hanmer of the same place.
They were made of the Poa Pratensis
or spear grass, and those which received
the premiums sold one for 27
dollars, the other 30 dollars. Another
of a quality almost equal to those
just mentioned was made by a young
lady of Windsor, of the sweet-scented
vernal grass, and one of split straw
by Miss Capen of Hartford, was remarkable
for its extraordinary delicacy
of texture.</p>

<p>The linen diapers were equal to
any of English fabric, and the linen
shirting which obtained the premium
sold for 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per yard. The committee
would suggest to such as
may hereafter be candidates for the
premium on linen goods, the necessity
of bleaching them, since after that
process, their comparative merits can
be more fairly ascertained.</p>

<p>The butter and cheese were excellent&mdash;the
former sold for 16 cents,
and a large quantity of the latter for
10 cents per pound.</p>

<p>Many articles were also exhibited
for which no premiums were offered,
yet which attracted the particular attention
of the committee and the numerous
spectators. Among these
were some highly finished treble-gilt
buttons, from the manufactory of Mr.
Moses Cook. The carpeting ingeniously
manufactured from bul-rushes
and woollen yarn; white silk hose,
white linen hose, white and coloured
counterpanes; a vandyke remarkable
for its softness and beauty, made from
the silk that covers the seed of the
milk-weed; an excellent imitation of
the Scotch plaid; and some elegant
paper-hangings from the manufactory
of Mr. George Putnam. While
the committee could not but regret
that the state of our funds precluded
the offering premiums for such meritorious
articles, yet they were highly
gratified to perceive that it is not
the hope of gain alone which produces
such a splendid collection of domestic
manufactures, but that there
exists among all classes of the community
a patriotic wish to give interest
to our exhibition.</p>

<p>Your committee cannot close their
report, without congratulating you,
gentlemen, and the public at large, on
the brilliant prospects of our infant
society.</p>

<p>The general superiority of the articles
we this year inspected, to those
offered at our former exhibition, together
with that lively interest they
excited in the candidates for premiums,
and the thousands of spectators
who assembled to witness the productions
of their industry, clearly evince
that domestic manufactures are rapidly
gaining that importance in public
estimation which they so richly
deserve.</p>

<p>All which is respectfully submitted.</p>

<h2>ANECDOTE.</h2>


<p>Catherine Shaw, daughter of John
Shaw, of Bargarron, having acquired
a remarkable degree of dexterity in
spinning fine flax, conceived the idea
of manufacturing it into thread. Her
first attempts were necessarily on a
small scale; she executed every part
herself, and bleached her materials
on a large slate, placed in a window.
Succeeding, in her first essays, she
engaged her family in the process,
and Lady Blentyre carried a parcel
of the thread to Bath, where she advantageously
disposed of it to the
lace manufacturers there. This was
the first thread that crossed the
Tweed. Subsequently a connection
of the family went to Holland, and
brought from thence the secret of the
twisting and twining machines in use
there, then carefully kept from public
observation; also the art of numbering
the threads, and packing them
for distant sale. The young women
of the neighbourhood engaged in it
also, and it became an object of profit
and interest to the place. What,
it will be asked, became of the ingenious
young woman who turned her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
talents to so great private advantage,
and eventually to such public utility.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Surely she lived honoured, and died
beloved. No! she was one of the
last victims to the imputed crime of
witchcraft in the south of Scotland!
Amongst many others, she was accused
of having evil agency with spirits,
and is described, in the records of
those unhappy times, as "young,
handsome, and well-informed." Can
it be possible that the superior activity
of her mind, and the industrious
efforts of her hands, could have involved
her in the disgraceful and
frantic measures, which terminated
in herself and five others being <em>burned
for witches</em> in 1626? This unfortunate
female was urged by her
friends to put in a plea to delay her
execution&mdash;she replied, with the dignity
of a Roman matron. "No; my
honour is already destroyed, and my
life is not worth defending!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>MISCELLANY.</h2>


<p><i>Scissors.</i>&mdash;A very valuable improvement
has been made on Scissors.
It is especially so to those employed
for delicate operations in surgery.
The objection to the common
scissors is, that, in the act of cutting,
they, to a very considerable extent,
compress and bruise the parts. This
is owing to the edges being set very
strong, and to the particular angle at
which they are set, and is sufficient to
account for wounds made by scissors
refusing to unite by what surgeons
call the first intention. To remedy
this defect, it was lately suggested to
Mr. Stodart, by Dr. Wollastan, to
give to scissors the same kind of cutting
edge that a knife has. This has
been done, and the success has fully
justified the experiment. The operation
of hair lip has been repeatedly
performed with the knife-edged scissors,
both on the infant and on the
adult, with complete success. The
operation is in this way performed
with facility to the operator, and in
less time than with the knife, and
consequently a less degree of pain to
the patient. This improvement need
not be confined to the science of surgery.
A variety of delicate fancy
work is performed by scissors, all of
which will be much better done
by giving them knife-edges. There
is a little art in setting the edges, readily
acquired by practice; this must
be done with a view to the kind of
work for which the scissors are intended.
This improvement may easily
be applied to common scissors,
by grinding down the outer sides of
the blades.</p>

<p class="sig">[<i>Lon. pap.</i></p>

<p><i>Public Spirit.</i>&mdash;It has been my
practice for several weeks past, to
walk upon one of our turnpike roads,
and, for about two weeks, I noticed a
very large stone, lying in what is
called the "summer road," which I
wished to remove, but my strength
was not sufficient to do it. It remained
there as permanent, to the great
annoyance of all who passed that way
in carriages. But one day as I was
passing it, I saw a stout negro fellow,
whose cart was <em>beyond</em> it as to the
course which he was going, tugging
at it, and he finally succeeded in putting
it out of the way, saying to himself
loud enough to be heard by me,
as he laid it down, "now you can't
upset any body!" Pleased with the
incident, I asked the man if he often
travelled that road. "No, sir," said
he. "Why, then, did you take so
much trouble to remove that large
stone?" "Because, sir," returned he,
"it might have upset some one in the
night!" I then left him, reflecting
that if all our politicians had a full
portion of the same public spirit, and
all our self-righteous persons as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
of a desire to do good to their fellow
men as this poor negro exhibited&mdash;we
should have a very different time
of it!</p>

<p class="sig">[<i>Niles's Reg.</i></p>

<p><i>Winter Butter.</i>&mdash;An idea prevails
very extensively, that <em>good butter</em>
cannot be made in the winter. This
is a great mistake. Where the process
is well understood, as fine butter
is made in the depths of winter, as at
any season of the year. By pursuing
the following course, the matter will
be accomplished:&mdash;</p>

<p>Let the cows be kept under cover
in a warm stable, well fed with the
best hay and provender, and milked
regularly morning and evening.&mdash;Place
the milk in pans, in as cold a
place as may be found about the dairy
house&mdash;the sooner it freezes the better.
As soon as it is frozen thoroughly,
take the cream from the
top&mdash;the frost will force the cream to
the surface&mdash;and churn it with no
other warmth than the air of the
kitchen at the distance of eight or ten
feet from the fire-place. It requires
more time to fetch the butter than in
summer; but when brought it will
be of the finest flavour and quality.</p>

<p><i>The Diamond.</i>&mdash;Dr. Brewster has
discovered a curious phenomenon,
which appears to elucidate the nature
of this substance. Sir Isaac
Newton observed, from a comparison
of the refractive powers of various
bodies, that amber and the diamond
had a refractive power three times
greater, in respect of their densities,
than several other substances, and he
conjectured that the diamond was
"probably an unctuous substance coagulated."
Subsequent discoveries
of the properties of sulphur and phosphorous
have corroborated this opinion.
Dr. Brewster has observed,
both in flat diamonds and those of a
perfect crystalline form (as well as in
amber,) the existence of globules, or
small portions of air, the expansive
force of which has communicated a
polarizing structure to the parts in
immediate contact with it. This
structure is displayed by four sectors
of polarizing light encircling the
globule of air, and can be produced
artificially in glass and gelatinous
masses. It must have been produced
by the expansive force of the included
air, when the substance was so
soft as to be susceptible of comparison
from so small a force. Hence
we are led to the conclusion that the
diamond originates, like amber, from
the consolidation of perhaps vegetable
matter, gradually acquiring a
crystalline form, by the influence of
time, and the slow action of corpsular
forces.</p>

<p><i>White Hills.</i>&mdash;The White Hills in
New Hampshire, are the highest in
the United States, being between 7
and 8000 feet above the level of the
ocean. The ascent is both difficult
and dangerous, as the sides of the
mountains consist of naked, rugged,
and precipitous rocks over which the
traveller is obliged to climb his slow
and toilsome way. The last of July
and the first of August is the only
time at which they can be ascended
at all, as they are the rest of the year
covered with snow.</p>

<p><i>Sizing.</i>&mdash;A French chemist has
recently discovered, that from the
starch of potatoes quite fresh, and
washed but once, a fine <em>size</em>, by mixing
with chalk, might be made. The
stucco plasterers of this country have
been benefited by the discovery, and
they find that this kind of size is particularly
useful for ceilings and for
white-washing, being more durable in
tenacity and whiteness, and not putrifying
like animal size or exhaling any
unwholesome odour.</p>

<p><i>Arabian Horses.</i>&mdash;Three fine Arabian
horses have arrived at Boston
from Tripoli. They are owned by
R. B. Jones, Esq. late American
Consul at that place, and a Mr.
Morgan.</p>

<p><i>Transplanting Wheat.</i>&mdash;In the
month of August, 1795, a gentleman
of Herefordshire, in England, set a
single grain of wheat. As soon as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
had properly taken root, he dug it
up, divided it into several parts, and
transplanted them. In August 1796,
it was reaped, when it produced 137
ears; the average of which was 80
grains in the ear; the total produce
10,960 grains of wheat, besides the
straw, most of which was seven feet
high.</p>

<p><i>Fall of a Glacier.</i>&mdash;On the 27th of
December, at six o'clock in the
morning, an enormous portion of the
glacier of Weisshorn, in the valley
of St. Nicholas, or Vispach, fell from
its exalted situation into the valley,
causing dreadful devastation amongst
the cultivated grounds and habitations.
At the moment when the ice and
snow struck the masses lying beneath,
the minister of the place, and many
other persons, observed a strong light,
which immediately disappeared, and
gave place to utter darkness. This
phenomenon, from the brightness of
the light, and the number of persons
who saw it, can scarcely be considered
as illusory. It was probably an electrical
or phosphorescent effect. The
mass of ice and snow covered a space
of 2400 feet in length, 1000 feet wide,
and at a mean 150 feet in height, and
the displacement of the air by it was
such as to cause a hurricane, which
destroyed houses, mills, and buildings,
even to the distance of a quarter of
a league from the place of the fall.
Extreme fears are entertained for
the remains of the village of Ronds,
which stands opposite the glacier, for
the upper part of the glacier, left unsupported
by the part which has
given way, threatens to fall and complete
the distress which has been
brought upon the inhabitants of the
valley.</p>

<p><i>Evolution of Heat by freezing.</i>&mdash;M.
de la Becha has devised an ingenious
way of shewing the heat evolved
by water during congelation.
He places a glass vessel, containing in
its lower part water, and upon that
olive oil, in a temperature below the
freezing point of water. In this temperature
olive oil alone would freeze
and thicken, but, being placed over
water, it is retained in the fluid state,
in consequence of the heat evolved
by the water during its conversion
into ice; and it is not until the whole
of the water is perfectly frozen that
the oil itself will freeze.&mdash;<cite>Bibliotheque
Universelle</cite>, xiii. 76.</p>

<p><i>Printing in Otaheite.</i>&mdash;M. Turgenieff,
Counsellor of State, has made
a report to the Bible Society of Petersburg,
in which it is stated that
the English missionaries, have established
a press at Otaheite, at which
3000 bibles have been printed. They
were all sold in the space of three
days, for three gallons of cocoa-nut
oil each. The books of Moses, translated
into the Otaheitean language,
have been printed at the same press;
also a catechism for the use of the
inhabitants. These have been distributed
gratuitously.</p>

<p><i>Animal Magnetism.</i>&mdash;The Royal
Academy of Sciences at Berlin have
proposed animal magnetism as a prize
subject, essays on which are to be
rewarded in August 1820. It is desired
that the phenomena, known by
the name of animal magnetism, be
described so as to admit of a positive
judgment respecting their nature:
and it is observed that, though there
are many difficulties attached to the
subject, still it appears that the number
of facts ascertained is such as to
admit the hope that, in the present
state of the physical sciences, some
light may be thrown on animal magnetism,
when the probability of these
facts has been estimated, and when
their analogy with the better understood
phenomena of natural sleep,
dreams, somnambulism not magnetic,
and many nervous affections, has been
established.</p>

<p><i>Milk.</i>&mdash;Professor Schubler has published
in the Dictionary of Medical
Sciences, a paper entitled, "Researches
on Milk and its constituent Principles."
The results of his analysis
differ greatly from those lately published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
by Berzelius; and hence, in
the author's opinion, prove the great
influence of food and climate on the
lacteal secretion. 1000 parts of new
milk contain 110 of fresh cheese, 50
of fresh <em>serai</em>, 24 of butter, 77 of
coarse sugar of milk, and 739 water;
or, in a dry state, 42.6 cheese,
7.87 <em>serai</em>, 24.0 butter, 77.0 sugar of
milk, and 848.53 water. 1000 parts
of skimmed milk contain 43.64 dry
cheese, 8.06 dry <em>serai</em>, 78.94 sugar
of milk, and 869.34 water. 1000
parts of cream contain 240 butter,
33 cheese, 6 <em>serai</em>, and 721 whey.
Lastly, 721 parts of whey contain 60
coarse sugar of milk.&mdash;These observations
were made at Howfyl, which
is some distance from the mountains,
and where the cows are kept constantly
in the stable, so that the milk
must be nearly the same as in other
flat countries.</p>

<p><i>Respiration and Circulation of the
Blood.</i>&mdash;Dr. Carson has lately made
some important experiments on the
elasticity of the lungs in different animals,
and he has found by the application
of a simple apparatus that in
oxen, and animals of their size, it is
more than equal in power to the
weight of a column of water a foot
and a half high. In calves, sheep,
and large dogs, it is balanced by a
column of water varying in height
from one foot to a foot and a half; and
in rabbits and cats by a column of
water varying from six to ten inches.
To this elasticity of the lungs alternating
with the irritability of the diaphragm,
Dr. C. ascribes respiration,
or the faculty of breathing; the capacity
of the chest being by their
means successively enlarged and diminished,
and thus air alternately expelled
and inhaled. He thinks also
with great probability that the movements
of the heart and the circulation
of the blood are powerfully influenced
by the same resilisency.</p>

<p><i>Beccaria.</i>&mdash;This philosopher of humanity
having, in one of the editions
of his admirable work on crimes
and punishments, in that part which
relates to fraudulent bankruptcy, qualified
some sentiments which he had
originally expressed, but which, on
reflection, appeared to himself too severe,
he adds in a note, "I am ashamed
of what I formerly wrote on this
subject. I have been accused of irreligion,
without deserving it; I have
been accused of disaffection to the
government, and deserved it as little;
I was guilty of a real attack upon
the rights of humanity, and <em>I have
been reproached by nobody</em>."</p>

<p><i>Generosity.</i>&mdash;It is an error to imagine
that men in the lowest rank of
life are unsusceptible of heroic and
generous sentiments. All who are
susceptible of enthusiasm are capable
of being actuated by them. It
is the minions of fortune, those who
have been pampered from their infancy,
by the hands of luxury, and
early accustomed to every kind of
profusion, whose minds sink into torpor
for want of exertion; it is such
as those that are more likely to be
unsusceptible of generous sentiments.</p>

<p><i>Academy of Natural Sciences.</i>&mdash;The
Academy of Natural Sciences in
this city has received from the president,
Mr. William Maclure, now in
France, a donation of books, amounting
in value to about $4000, and have
received advice of another valuable
shipment from the same munificent
hand.</p>

<p><i>Method of preserving Vessels.</i>&mdash;An
American ship now at Cowes, built
with spruce and white oak, sixteen
years ago, has all her original timbers
and planks in the most perfect
state of preservation and soundness,
owing to her having been, while on
the stocks, filled up between the timbers
with salt; and whenever she has
been opened for examination filled up
again.</p>

<p><i>General Post-Office.</i>&mdash;The number
of post-offices in the United States is
four thousand eight hundred and thirty,
and the length of post-roads is
71,522 miles. The amount of postage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
for the year 1819, was $1,204,680;
the cost of transportation of the mail
$717,843; and the compensation to
postmasters $375,964.</p>

<p><i>Bibliomania.</i>&mdash;At no time during
the highest age of Bibliomanianism
did books of rarity bear higher prices
than at the concluding sale of Mr.
Bindley's library. The competition
for old poetical tracts and ballads was
unexampled.</p>

<p><i>Precious Stones.</i>&mdash;A diamond said
to be worth 20,000<i>l.</i> and one of the
largest in the world, was among the
spoils of the Peishwa, and is now in
the East India Company's treasury,
to be sold for the benefit of the captors.
It was brought to England by
the ship York. A block of amethyst,
or rather a mass of amethysts, has
been sent from Brazil to Calcutta.
This extraordinary specimen is four
feet in circumference, and weighs 98
pounds. It is in its rough state, and
consists of more than 50 irregular
columns, smooth, transparent, purple
and white, shooting up like crystals
from a common matrix.</p>

<p><i>Nautical Improvement.</i>&mdash;We congratulate
the public on the application
of a simple mechanical apparatus
to impel boats, instead of oars.
It consists of the machinery of steam-vessels,
but the moving power is the
hand applied to a windlass. Boats
were first used on this principle with
success on Whit-Monday, between
London and Greenwich. The labour
is much less than that of oars, and
the impulse of the boat through the
water much increased in swiftness.</p>

<p><i>Philosophic Girl.</i>&mdash;The Italian journals
mention that a young lady, only
13 years of age, named Maria Catherina
Gherardi, a native of Scrola, has
maintained in public a series of philosophic
theses, in Latin.</p>

<p><i>Ingenious Automaton.</i>&mdash;A German
journal asserts, that an artist at Cemberg,
in Prussia, has constructed a
watch which imitates the human
voice, and answers questions in German
and Polish; besides executing
musical airs.</p>

<p><i>To destroy Caterpillars.</i>&mdash;A gardener
at Glasgow practices a mode of
destroying caterpillars, which he discovered
by accident. A piece of woollen
rag had been blown by the wind
into a currant bush, and when taken
out was found covered with these leaf-devouring
insects. He immediately
placed pieces of woollen cloth in
every bush in his garden, and found
next day that the caterpillars had universally
taken to them for shelter. In
this way he destroys many thousands
every morning.</p>

<p><i>Vegetation in cold Climates.</i>&mdash;The
following is a calendar of a Siberian
Lapland year:</p>


<div class="center">

<p>Thus it appears, that from their
first emerging from the ground to the
ripening of their seeds, the plants
take but a month; and spring, summer,
and autumn are crowded into
the short space of 56 days.</p>

<p>There are other paths to the temple of fame,
than those which lead through blood and
slaughter. This truth cannot too frequently
be inculcated on the minds of the rising generation.
Our own country keeps pace with the
nations of the old world, in applauding deeds
of arms; apparently forgetful of the fact, that
there are other incentives to ambition, of a
much more useful and honourable character.
He who augments the stock of public happiness,
by improving the condition of his fellow
creatures, or enriches the nation by developing
her resources, is entitled to her thanks, and
will probably receive them: At all events he
will reap with certainty the high reward of
self-approbation. The following stanzas to the
memory of the late Duke of Bridgewater, were
written by one who enjoys the rare distinction
of being at once a painter and a poet, of no
ordinary pretensions. What ample scope is
furnished to Pennsylvania, and what cogent
inducements may be found in the example of
some of her neighbours, for adopting zealously,
without further delay, a great and efficient
plan of <span class="smcap">Internal Improvement</span>. Should she
evince the public spirit of Bridgewater, a
Brindley will no doubt be found, to aid her in
the important object of uniting the waters of
the Ohio and the Delaware. This would add
one more to the catalogue of those pacific but
glorious triumphs, which have rendered her
name celebrated throughout the civilized
world.</p>

<span class="i2">As if they ripe berries would yield.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought this was pretty, and ne'er heard you say<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That the leaves would soon fall from the tree;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">But the leaves every year drop around&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are green in their youth, and turn red when they're old,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then the wind blows them down to the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But take comfort, my boy&mdash;when the winter is fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The leaves will appear on the tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And again form a bower thy father to shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the gambols of sister and thee."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Why, that's good&mdash;but, my father, I've sad news to tell;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Old William, who liv'd at Hillside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lately came hither so wan and so pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Old William this morning hath died."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Old William hath died! Ah! indeed, I am sad;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But age, when it ripens, must fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though green was his summer, his autumn must fade;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Such, my boy, is the end of us all."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then he fell like the leaves of your favourite tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But when the long winter is o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old William again on the hills shall we see<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A feeding his flock as before?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ah, no! my sweet boy!&mdash;the dead wander no more<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the bounds of this wind-wasted scene;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to regions immortal all good spirits soar,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">More lovely, more lasting, and green."<br /></span>

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> This great swamp, containing nearly
150,000 acres, lies more in North Carolina
than Virginia. It is a marshy region, covered
with a thick growth of cypress or
juniper, many of which trees are of a prodigious
growth. These trees are occasionally
intermingled with oak, poplar, and
maple. The annual fall of leaves, and the
decay of trees, raise the surface above the
original soil some feet, this part being completely
saturated with water. The improvements
in agriculture have done much
to drain this vast surface, and many parts are
sufficiently dry for the shingle-cutters and
stave-makers to pursue their avocations in
spots of this dreary region.</p></div>
